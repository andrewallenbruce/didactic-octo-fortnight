# Track Medical Staff Productivity
Would you like to track medical staff productivity? Does working from home concern you? Today’s BIG Ideas podcast describes a practice who data mines staff’s entries by time of day to see when staff are most and least productive.  One the manager has the data, Excel makes it easy to trend productivity by time of day, day of week, week over week, etc.  With all the staffing issues practices face today, the ability to track medical staff productivity can make a big difference in your practice.  Automating the analysis will make managers more productive as well.  Thanks for joining me today.

# Rescheduled Patients
If 100 patients schedule an appointment with your practice, how many of those appointments are rescheduled? Today’s BIG Ideas Podcast encourages practices to get some data around how many patient appointments are rescheduled.  MGMA surveys show that around 20% of patient appointments in the average medical practice end up being rescheduled.  At a time when hiring staff has never been harder, the last thing practices need is extra work rescheduling patients.  Worse, for as diligently as practices work to market their physicians, a good percentage of those rescheduled patients never make it to their appointment.  Listen to today’s podcast for ideas on how to identify and reduce your rescheduled patients.

# Medical Provider Productivity
Is it time to rethink medical provider productivity in your practice? Today’s BIG Idea is a new project for a group in the rural Midwest.  Post-pandemic, providers have slowed down in terms of seeing patients and getting charts signed.  We are working on building a dashboard to automatically email providers weekly with the number of charts to be signed and the number of patient visits.  Phase two of the dashboard will tie patient visits and work RVUs to the provider compensation model.  Adding compensation helps align goals and motivates providers to open the weekly email.  What would be on a medical provider productivity dashboard in your practice?

# Find New Patients by Finding Canceled Patients
Need to find new patients for your practice? A good potential source to find new patients is patients who set an appointment with your practice and then canceled before the appointment date.  This idea is dependent on your practice specialty, but when was the last time you followed up with patients who have canceled their initial appointment with the practice?  I have never seen a canned report that tracks patients who have canceled and never rescheduled, but your IT group can build this in SQL Server without too much trouble.  Today’s BIG Ideas podcast suggests ways to mine and leverage this data.  Find new patients in your practice by listening today.

# Can Days to Schedule Drive No Shows?
Ready for a new idea to reduce no show appointments? Today’s BIG Idea is to review how it takes for patients who end up missing their appointment to see your providers.  The longer patients have to wait to see your providers, the greater the risk of a no show appointment.  Today’s example is from a children’s specialty practice whose providers can be hard to get in to see. Listen to how we created the analysis and for some ideas on reducing the wait to see your providers as well as your no show rate.  I hope these podcasts are helpful for you.
