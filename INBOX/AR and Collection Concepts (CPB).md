# A/R and Collection Concepts

## Explanation of Benefits (EOB) and Remittance Advice (RA) 

An Explanation of Benefits (EOB) is a statement sent by an insurance carrier to the covered individuals explaining what medical treatments and/or services were paid for on their behalf. A Remittance Advice (RA) is a statement sent by an insurance carrier to the medical provider which explains the adjudication decisions on those claims submitted by the provider. An Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) is an electronic statement sent by an insurance carrier to the medical provider which explains the adjudication decisions on those claims submitted by the provider. 

### The RA and ERA include the following information:
- Identifying information for all parties including the patient, medical provider, and insurance carrier
- Claim amounts that include amount charged, amount paid, adjustments applied to the claim, and claim total
- Claim status such as paid, denied, or pending
- Explanation of decision 

 The EOB sent to the patient will typically have a statement stating it is not a bill.

### A/R Management 
Accounts receivable (A/R) represents money owed to the healthcare practice by patients and/or insurance carriers. The accounts receivable cycle begins with the delivery of service and continues until payment for the service is reconciled to a zero balance. 

Accounts receivable management is a system that assists providers in the collection of the reimbursement for services rendered. The functions of accounts receivable management include insurance verification, insurance eligibility, prior authorization, billing and claims submission, posting payments, and collections. 

#### Days in A/R 
The success of a practice’s billing operations is often measured in A/R days. The A/R balance can be reduced by receiving payments or by entering contractual or write off adjustments. It is important to manage the A/R balance as claims become much more difficult to collect the older they become. Good management of the A/R is also imperative to maintaining a good cash flow for the business. A poor A/R process can result in loss of money to the business and result in financial strains to the owners. 

If all these tasks are being done properly, the days in A/R number should be low, in contrast, high days in A/R number will most likely tell you there is a problem in your revenue cycle.

Days in A/R is a fraction. The numerator is the total A/R. The denominator is average daily charges. Average daily charges are calculated by taking the total charges over the last 2 months (can also be one month) and dividing by the total number of days in those two (or one) months. 

Example:

Total A/R = $200,000$

Average Daily Charge = $4,250$

Days in A/R = $\frac{200,000}{4,250} = 47.06$ days

#### Steps to Working the Account Receivables 
Efficient accounts receivable management is crucial to the financial viability of a medical practice. Steps to help reduce the accounts receivable include: 
##### Financial policy
A practice must have a financial policy that is conveyed to every patient. The policy should be posted at the front desk, a copy should be given to every new patient, and the front office should clearly communicate the policy to patients. The financial policy should explain the total expected cost of the visit and convey that copayments, co-insurance, and/or deductibles are required at the time of service. The policy should also detail the insurance plans that are accepted, and the practice’s policy for out-of-network insurance policies.
##### Verify insurance
The patient’s insurance should be verified every time a patient is seen. The patient may present an insurance card but that does not mean they are insured. Coverage changes are common. A patient may change insurance plans, identification numbers may change, or the copayments and deductibles may change. Prior to treatment, the insurance carrier should be contacted to confirm coverage and the amount to be collected from the patient. This can be done through phone calls, the insurance carrier’s website, or through the clearinghouse.
##### Registration Process
The patient registration process is one of the most important jobs when it comes to account receivables. Accurate information must be obtained initially to avoid costly errors later. Claims can be denied by the insurance carrier if the correct information is not collected. A patient statement cannot be paid if it isn’t delivered to the patient. An incorrect address can result in postal returns. Ask the patient the information in the correct way. Do not ask “has your information changed?” Instead the front desk staff should ask the patient “what is your address, phone, employment, and insurance information.” Have the patient give answers to open ended questions instead of a yes or no confirmation. 
##### Collections
Copayments should be collected by the front desk at registration. It is more difficult to collect payment after the patient has received treatment. Many times, patients will leave the office without paying or state they forgot their checkbook or debit card at home. When this happens, the practice has the added cost of sending a statement to the patient to collect the money that should have been collected up front. The routine waiver of copayments can also open the practice up to liability. Many contracts also require the collection of copayments. Make it easy for patients to pay by offering multiple payment options such as accepting cash, checks, and credit or debit cards.
##### Submit Claims Correctly
Health insurance claims are most often rejected due to inaccurate or missing information. A claim denied by the health insurance company can result in adding a few weeks to the A/R days because the patient’s information must be pulled, verified, and corrected in the practice management system before the claim is resubmitted.
##### Monitor
After an insurance carrier processes a claim, an RA or ERA is sent to the provider with payments from the insurance carriers. This should be posted immediately upon receipt. Payments should be monitored to assure that the claims are being processed and paid appropriately. It is also important to monitor that the payments are posted correctly including the amount adjusted and billed to the secondary carrier or the patient.
##### Denials
Denials or reimbursement problems should be worked as soon as they are received from the insurance carriers. Each denied claim should be reviewed to determine whether additional information is needed, if errors need to be corrected, or if the denial should be appealed. These denials will be identified when posting the payments, reviewing remittance advice, and on aging reports.
##### Patient Statements/Invoices
Patient statements should be sent as the remittance advice has been posted. The sooner the statement is received by the patient, the sooner it is likely to be paid. Patient statements should detail the date of service, services performed, insurance reimbursement received, payments collected at the time of service, and reason the patient balance is due.
##### Write-offs
The financial policy should address the handling of past due accounts. A practice may automatically write off small patient balances for which processing costs exceed potential collections. The example above is a summary report. If the practice management system is interactive, clicking on the insurance carrier name will provide more detail including dates of services and patient names included in the balance. If not interactive, a more detailed report will need to be printed. 

Insurance pending accounts should be worked aggressively, every month. The accounts receivable aging summary should be worked starting with the oldest claims and/or largest balances first. The longer a balance sits in the accounts receivable the less likely it will be paid. The oldest claims should be worked before the newer claims because of timely filing requirements. If for some reason the insurance carrier did not receive the claim, it will need to be resubmitted within the timely filing time frame. It is also important to work the largest balances. There will be a greater return on claims where there is a larger balance. 

 Some offices will set internal policies assigning certain carriers to specific employees. Internal policies will dictate which accounts are worked and in what order. 

##### Claims Tracking 
Tracking an insurance claim can allow for a quicker response time for correcting and/or resubmitting a claim. Most carriers will process a claim and make payment within 15 days. Claims can be tracked by looking the claim up on the insurance carrier website, making a phone call to the insurance carrier, or utilizing a clearinghouse claims status system. Tracking a claim can sometimes determine the status of the claim faster than waiting for the insurance carrier to respond. Once the status of a claim is determined, the biller can then follow up on the claim. 

Common claim statuses found when tracking a claim include: 

- No record of the claim: If the claim was never received by the insurance carrier, a new claim can be submitted.
- Claim denied: If the claim was denied the denial can be investigated, corrected, and resubmitted.
- Claim pending: If the claim is pending for information from the member, this will allow the member to be notified and the provider’s office can assist the member with contacting the insurance carrier and giving the additional information needed.
- Claim paid: The biller may be required to locate the check and EOB to determine if the payment was inadvertently applied to an incorrect account. 

 The Prompt Payment Act is a federal law that ensures federal agencies pay their bills within 30 days of receipt and acceptance of material and/or services. When payments are not made in a timely manner, interest should be automatically paid.
