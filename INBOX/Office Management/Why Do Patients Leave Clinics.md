I remember a report I read back in the early 90s about why a patient will leave one practice and go to another. I don’t remember all of the reasons, but I do remember the first 7:

1.  The physician has an “I don’t care” attitude or talks over my head and doesn’t take the time to help me understand my own treatment or condition.
    
2.  The staff treats me like they’re doing me a favor by taking care of me.
    
3.  Which managed care plans or insurance does the practice accept
    
4.  How close to my home or work is this practice
    
5.  How clean and comfortable is the reception area – including how current the magazines are
    
6.  What hours the practice is open
    
7.  What are the fees they charge?
    

Think about this. The cleanliness of the reception area is MORE important to patients than the FEES you charge. I’ve been in an OB/GYN office that had sporting and hunting magazines in the reception area and no magazines designed for women’s interests. Yes – I know that some women like sports (I’m blessed that my wife likes the NFL as much as I do – if not more) and some like to hunt – but by and large – most women prefer other types of magazines. 

They also need to be in good taste as well. You do not want the February edition of Sports Illustrated sitting in your reception area if you see a lot of geriatric men or you may need the defibrillator and calling 911, as February is the Swimsuit edition. Make sure your magazines are appropriate to your type of patients and their interests.

Also – you need to police the type of television shows you have on the television if you have a television in your reception area, as some are DEFINITELY not suitable for a professional image. I really do not care what your receptionist watches at home – but you should care what she puts on the television in your reception area.
