The 2006 Tax Relief and Health Care Act required the establishment of a Physician Quality Reporting System, including an incentive payment for eligible professionals (EPs) who satisfactorily report data on quality measures for covered professional services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries during the second half of 2007 (the 2007 reporting period). CMS named this program the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRS).

PQRS was replaced by MACRA & MIPS but the lessons we learned from PQRS can make a huge difference in how we treat patients – if we use them. The idea behind PQRS, MACRA, AHRQ, HEDIS and all is simple. Provide better care to our patients, get better outcomes and reduce the expense at the same time by capturing problems and treating early. This saves the government money and saves insurance carriers money.

If you’re wondering why I say that this saves the insurance carriers money, you should think about it from their perspective. We know from the NIH reports that I quoted earlier that 1 out of every 3 diabetic patients over 50 have Peripheral Arterial Disease and many of those patients will end up having a toe or a foot amputated, if the complications of the disease doesn’t kill them first.

Typical amputations (when you consider the cost of the surgeon, hospital, anesthesiologist, lab, radiology, therapy and time off work) usually runs between $20,000 and $60,000 – also depending on whether it is a toe, foot or worse… Most carriers are glad to pay $120 to $140 for an ankle brachial index to determine whether the patient has Peripheral Arterial Disease at an early enough stage so that they do not eventually have to fork over the $20,000 for an amputation.

This “Evidence Based Medicine” is a big part of not only the MACRA and AHRQ, but also the “family centered home” concept.

# Reporting MIPS the Easy Way

I am still seeing practices reporting MIPS via claims method, which is cumbersome, time consuming and not guaranteed to meet the 100% threshold. Instead of taking the most difficult path to reporting, we recommend you use Registry Reporting as it is easy, fast and does not require your physician to be involved with the reporting AT ALL. Again – keep it easy and keep it simple and that makes it best for everyone. Instead of paying a consultant to come into your practice to help you complete and meet all that MACRA/MIPS requires, we have an easy solution for you.

Go to MIPSPROP.COM and watch their videos and use their online service to report MIPS. Keep it simple and take the time you would have wasted on that and use it for profitable ventures in your clinic. If you use DONSELF2021 as the code, it gives you a discount as we have had hundreds of clients use them.

# WHAT PQRS HAS TAUGHT US

### PQRS # 1 – Diabetes: Hemoglobin A1c

The first measure of PQRS 15 years ago was about A1Cs on Diabetics. Medicare realizes that physicians are NOT ordering A1Cs on diabetic patients often enough and that is hurting the patients. In fact, several national carriers, such as Blue Cross, Blue Shield, Aetna and UnitedHealthCare have even sent letters to the physicians in their networks reminding them to routinely do Hemoglobin A1C tests on diabetic patients. Medicare (and other carriers) WANT doctors to order A1Cs more often.

Medicare advised in PQRS they wanted patients with A1C above 7% tested on every visit to help the doctors monitor and treat. Controlled patients should be tested every 3 months, per the statements from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (and those people should know a thing or two about diabetes and A1Cs). So – how does this help the average family or Internal Medicine physician? Medicare pays an average of $13.56 for CPT 83036 and many carriers pay much more than that.

Physicians with waived testing in their office have a cost of $8.00—with $5.56 profit. A physician with non-waived testing in their office has an expense ranging from $1.00 to $4.00 (on average) for performing A1Cs in their office. Now – before you start thinking to yourself that you don’t have the number of patients that would warrant non-waived testing in your office, you should at least take a closer look at it.

At the same time, in 2019, Medicare started paying for Remote Patient Monitoring for diabetic and hypertensive patients for a good reason. As we’ll discuss later in this book, RPM helps patients improve compliance while helping the medical practitioners stay on top of the patient’s condition. As we’ll also discuss later, most primary care offices seeing at least 25 patients a day should consider SOME non-waived testing as the profit is much more than they actually realize.

On top of that, the best benefit is that you have the point-of-care information and that ALWAYS helps YOU to be a better doctor! Physicians not performing this test in their office have ZERO profit since Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare and most HMOs and PPOs prohibit pass-through billing for clinical lab tests not performed IN the physician’s office. A practice seeing 25 patients a day with 40% of the patients having diabetes sees about 10 patients a day with diabetes. If half (5) are being seen for their quarterly visits and 10% of the other diabetics have A1Cs above 7%, that gives you 6 A1Cs a day.

If the primary care practice has the non-waived lab equipment, not only does the practice get to make the 1.5% bonus from Medicare, but they also get to make $17,160 per year in profit from providing better care for the patients—based on only 6 A1Cs a day. Now maybe $17,160 a year won’t make any difference in your practice – but for many, it’s a good start!

### PQRS #2: Diabetes Mellitus: (LDL-C) Control

This is another test that should be performed in most primary care offices since it gives point-of-care information, and it adds to the profit of a practice.

Medicare wants you to report on this at least once a year. In fact, the National Coverage Determination (NCD) that Medicare published in January 2010 states: “Any one component of the panel or a measured LDL (CPT 83721) may be reasonable and necessary up to six times the first year for monitoring dietary or pharmacologic therapy. More frequent total cholesterol HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride testing may be indicated for marked elevations or for changes to anti-lipid therapy due to inadequate initial patient response to dietary or pharmacologic therapy.

The LDL cholesterol or total cholesterol may be measured three times yearly after treatment goals have been achieved. Ok – we know WHY they want you to run Lipid Panel, LDL and the tests and how often they want it. So how often are YOU running them on your patients that fall within the 360 or so diagnosis codes that are covered for these tests? Of course, you need to believe in the test and that it will be medically indicated and medically beneficial to the care of your patient before you run it, but we assume that you already are. If not – you may want to check with the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists or the American College of Endocrinology as they have convinced the AHRQ, PQRS, PCPI and HHS to make these guidelines the standards.

Naturally, you’re wondering if you will lose money by doing these tests in your office and while we may need to perform a free diagnostic analysis) to determine whether it would be profitable for you to consider doing LDL Direct in your office, it is USUALLY profitable to be doing liver panels in your office, whether you’re solo or a group primary care practice. Typically, it costs a practice about $12 to run a liver panel in the office and the usual reimbursement from Medicare is around $20, so that $8.00 adds up. Consequently, you not only get to qualify for the MIPS but you get to make another $8.00 by following Medicare’s guidelines as well. How many diabetic patients do you see daily that you’re letting one of the big labs make the money on that you might be missing?

### PQRS #3 BP & Diabetes

While most doctors were very familiar with the recommended testing of the A1Cs, liver panels and LDLs on diabetic patients, many do not give the same attention to the blood pressures. Measure 3 has a description of: “Percentage of patients aged 18 through 75 years with diabetes mellitus who had most recent blood pressure in control (less than 140/80 mmHg”, although I think they are really MORE interested in the number of diabetic patients whose blood pressure is NOT in control.

Medicare is trying to get physicians to take blood pressures on diabetics on every visit (which, I believe every physician does). What they are not doing is checking for orthostatic blood pressures. The PQRS explains the rationale as “Intensive control of blood pressure in patients with diabetes reduces diabetes complications, diabetes-related deaths, strokes, heart failure, and microvascular complications.”

By now, you may have heard that the American College of Cardiology reports that 61% of diabetics suffer from silent ischemia, possibly due to cardiac autonomic neuropathy. But—how do you detect it if the patient’s blood pressure appears normal while sitting without the comparison of that same pressure while standing?

The PQRS says: “Blood pressure should be measured at every routine diabetes visit.

Patients found to have systolic blood pressure >130 mmHg or diastolic >80 mmHg should have blood pressure confirmed on a separate day. Orthostatic measurement of blood pressure should be performed to assess the presence of autonomic neuropathy.”

Yet—how many times a day does your staff take a patient’s blood pressure while standing, after taking one while the patient was sitting or prone to see if you have a 25/10 mm mercury drop? Do you have the patient stand for at least 2 minutes prior to taking the orthostatic pressure, which is recommended since many patients will experience Delayed Orthostatic Hypotension (DOH)?

There is not a separate CPT or HCPCS code for standing blood pressure YET, so—you’re probably thinking that this is additional work and time (if you’re going to make the medical assistant stand there for 2 minutes with the patient prior to actually taking the standing pressure) that you’re not going to be compensated for. If so—you are incorrect, which we will discuss in a bit.

### PQRS # 51 – (COPD): Spirometry Evaluation

The description of Measure 51 says “Percentage of patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of COPD who had spirometry evaluation results documented.”

The rationale behind requesting this data on COPD patients is simple. “Evaluation of lung function for a patient with COPD is vital to determine what treatments are needed and whether those treatments are effective.” The sad part is that most primary care physicians are not screening for COPD, so by the time they diagnose that there is a problem, the patient already has COPD.

You screen for hypertension by doing blood pressure checks on patients on every visit, probably because cardiac disease is the number 1 killer. We screen for diabetes by running A1Cs and glucose tests. Yet—we’re not routinely screening for the number 4 killer, COPD, and (partly) because of this, we’re expecting COPD to be the number 3 killer in our country by 2020 (per the National Institute of Health).

The clinical Recommendations included in the PQRS (from the American Thoracic Society) state: “Spirometry should be performed in all patients suspected of COPD. This is necessary for diagnosis, assessment of severity of the disease and for following the progress of the disease.” For the diagnosis and assessment of COPD, spirometry is the gold standard as it is the most reproducible, standardized, and objective way of measuring airflow limitation. FEV1/FVC < 70% and a post-bronchodilator FEV1 < 80% predicted confirms the presence of airflow limitation that is not fully reversible, per the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute.

OK—so they want us to test those SUSPECTED of having COPD to determine if they have it and then they want tests to see what treatment is most effective. This one is easy. If you do a spirometry (94010), you make $31.06 (average) from Medicare. If you do a pre-and a post bronchodilator exam, you bill 94060 and you just made $48.87 from Medicare and the patient. If you’re using a spirometer to perform either of these, you have just checked the mechanics of the lung to see if there is an FEV1/FVC less than 70%. Yet—if the mechanics of the lung are ok—you still don’t know anything about the diffusion, gas exchange, etc… because you did not check the diffusion or gas exchange when you did only a spirometry or a pre-post spirometry.

You have a choice. Do you make the $48.87 from Medicare or do you perform a real PFT in your office whereby you get very useful information including the vital capacity, maximum breathing capacity, functional residual capacity, thoracic gas volume, determination of resistance to airflow, evaluation of aerosol or nebulizer and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity?

The PFT devices that do all of this costs about $47,000, which on a 5-year lease runs about $1050 per month (based on good credit with a $1.00 buyout and no payments for the first 3 months). If you only did 2 tests per day, your annual gross income would be about $11,000.

If you’re wondering who in your office can do the test, Florida is the only state we know of that requires a licensed respiratory technician perform it—to the best of my knowledge, although that may change (which is why I always check the current NCDs and LCDs immediately prior to recommending spirometry or PFT to any physician.

In fact, Florida requires the licensed respiratory technician, or the physician personally perform the spirometry and my estimation is that 80% of the physicians I’ve talked to in Florida doing spirometers are not meeting that Medicare guideline. The respiratory tech is not an RN, LVN, MA, either. Doing these helps you detect, diagnose and treat those patients that are non-diagnostic on the mechanics but have severe problems and it gives you increased income. A simple spirometer can usually be bought from Schein, PSS or McKesson for $800 to $900.

Even though we no longer report PQRS and it has been replaced by MACRA, the lessons from PQRS can help you know what Medicare expects from the medical providers.

### PQRS #126 – Diabetes and Foot Exams

“Foot ulceration is the most common single precursor to lower extremity amputations among persons with diabetes. Treatment of infected foot wounds accounts for up to one-quarter of all inpatient hospital admissions for people with diabetes in the United States. Peripheral sensory neuropathy in the absence of perceived trauma is the primary factor leading to diabetic foot ulcerations. Approximately 45-60% of all diabetic ulcerations are purely neuropathic. In people with diabetes, 22.8% have foot problems – such as amputations and numbness – compared with 10% of non-diabetics.”

Over the age of 40 years old, 30% of people with diabetes have loss of sensation in their feet (Diabetes with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders).” This is a quote from the PQRS Measure #126 from 15 years ago! I’m sure it is worse today. This is additional justification for physicians to be checking for Peripheral Arterial Disease. Measure 126 allows clinicians to report on PQRS for the examination they should be performing quarterly to annually (depending on the symptoms present) on their patients.

If 30% of the diabetics in this country, over 40, have a loss of sensation in their feet—then primary care physicians should be testing these people for Peripheral Arterial Disease much more often than they have been. Accordingly, the referral of patients to Podiatrists by primary care physicians should be at an all-time high to help the patients prevent amputations. We will talk about the ABI devices later in this book, but one thing to realize is that just a minimum 2 tests a month on Medicare patients more than pays for the new equipment. Most of our primary care physicians with ABIs are doing 1 to 2 per DAY!
