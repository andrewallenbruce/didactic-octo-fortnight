##### The Experience Section

When you’re writing a resume, the experience section provides detailed information about your employment history. This is the real heart of your resume, and you will have to decide which positions to include and which to leave out in this section.

##### Email Address

This section of your resume is where employers will look to see what jobs and job titles you’ve held in the past. Also, it gives employers a sense of your best accomplishments.

##### Formatting the Experience Section

You do not have to include every detail of your role but you NEED to include the information below for every position you have on your resume:

**Your Position Title**

-   Do not change your job title! Use the title that you were hired for

**Name of the Company**

-   Spell the simplest version of the name
-   Example: Use “Google” not “Google, Inc”

**Dates of Employment**

-   Spell out the full month & year
-   Example: December 2015—June 2016

**Location of Employment**

-   Include the city and state for each company

##### Writing the Experience Section

The content in this section is the most important part of your resume. Elaborating on the details of what you've done is how you make it great.

Take some time to think about accomplishments for your past jobs, list the specific activities and duties that you were responsible for. Next, craft exciting and concise bullet points representing those activities.

Most companies use Applicant TrackingSystems which are softwares used to help manage application profiles. It’s important to include content that help the ATS find your resume. This is why it is crucial to tailor the content to match the keywords in the job description.

Here’s an important rule that needs to be followed: Each bullet point should contain enough information to make a complete thought. Do not exceed two lines of text per bullet point.

##### A Tip for Writing Experience

You can rely on answering WHAT, WHY, and HOW, to create a well-thought out and complete bullet point.

**What**

“What” explains what you did for your duties.Try to add numbers to quantify results.

**Why**

“Why” explains the purpose of the duties and the impact that your actions had.

**How**

“How” gives details on the specific tools you’ve used for the duty. Answering “how” is your chance to include hard keywords from the job description.
