##### The Skills Section

A skills section is an important place to summarize the skills you have acquired from past experiences.

Remember to highlight the specific hard skills which make you a good fit for the job.

-   Hard Skills: Java, HTML/CSS
-   Soft Skills: Friendly, Teamwork

##### Hard Skills

Hard skills are teachable abilities that can be defined and measured more so than soft skills. Hard skills are easy to quantify.

##### Soft Skills

Soft skills are personality-driven and subjective skills that should usually not be included in this section since they do not bring much concrete value to your resume.
