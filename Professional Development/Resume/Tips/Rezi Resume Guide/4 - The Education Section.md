##### The Education Section

Many organizations give preference to educational backgrounds. As a result, itâ€™s important to highlight your academic records. You should put your highest degree on top and then lower qualifications below.

**Include:**

-   Degree & major
-   School name
-   City, state of school
-   Graduation (month, year)
-   Minor
-   GPA if above 3.0
