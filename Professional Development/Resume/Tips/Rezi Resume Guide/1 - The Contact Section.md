Your name should always be at the top of the resume in a large and readable font. Directly underneath is where you can add your contact information. At the minimum, your contact information should include the following:

## Email Address
-   Pick an address you check often
-   Make sure it’s easy to spell
-   Avoid using an unprofessional address

## Phone Number
-   Always include an area code
-   Make sure it’s still in service
-   Use your mobile phone number

## Home Location
-   City & State/Country is most important
-   There’s no reason to list a specific address

## You may want to include additional information:
-   Linkedin URL
-   Work Portfolio
-   Personal Website
-   Skype ID
