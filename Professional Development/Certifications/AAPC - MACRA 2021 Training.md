## MACRA Proficiency 2021 Training
### Description
The 2021 Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) performance threshold is higher than ever, which means few clinicians will receive zero-payment adjustments in Year 5. It also means that incentive payments—and financial penalties—will be at their highest since the implementation of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA). Are you up to speed on MACRA 2021 requirements? Get your annual MACRA training from AAPC, the leader in medical coding and healthcare business compliance—and ensure your organization's Year 5 performance earns optimal Quality Payment Program (QPP) rewards.
#### Who Should Take the MACRA Proficiency Course?
- Medical coders who understand the QPP are essential for clinicians to earn full credit for the quality care they provide.
- Newly certified coders and CPC students entering the field with MACRA know-how have greater professional value in helping their teams succeed.
- Practice managers who can identify and address performance gaps will significantly improve their profit margin and boost job satisfaction. Need to update in the content.
- Clinicians and physicians who recognize MACRA opportunities can leverage them and reap optimum rewards from the program.
- Auditors and CDI specialists responsible for reviewing coding and clinical records will ensure claims and data submissions meet requirements and support Quality measures. They'll also know which documentation to retain in the event of a MACRA audit.
- Medical billers will be equipped to serve as the organization’s last line of defense, verifying that claims are submitted in accordance with MACRA requirements.

Whether you're new to the QPP or have been participating since its inception in 2017, AAPC will prepare you to excel in MACRA Year 5. And the best part is—it only takes 1 day (6 to 7 hours)!
#### In the AAPC's MACRA Proficiency Course, you'll learn:
- How to define your practice’s goals for the QPP performance period
- Coding requirements to ensure your clinicians receive proper credit in MIPS
- Which Quality measures best align with your practice
- Whether it's more advantageous to report MIPS as a group or individually
- How to reap rewards with Improvement Activities
- How to seize bonus point opportunities
- Why patient relationship codes are important and how to use them
- How to determine if you qualify for an exception or category reweighting
- Reporting requirements for MIPS and MIPS APMs
- Special requirements for small practices, non-patient-facing providers, MIPS APM participants, and more
- How to report MIPS data when providers bill under more than one TIN
- The best submission mechanism for MIPS Quality data
- To understand the APM track and key distinctions between MIPS APMs, Advanced APMs, and All-Payer Advanced APMs
- Steps to take before you decide to enter an APM agreement
- How to review performance feedback reports to identify your most costly patient population conditions and diagnoses
#### Can I use this designation on my signature line with my credential?
Once you earn your MACRA Proficiency Certificate, you may add "AAPC MACRA Proficient" to your signature line, prefixed by the certificate year (e.g.: Jane Smith, CPC, 2021 AAPC MACRA Proficient). The MACRA Proficient credential validates your knowledge of the Medicare QPP tracks for 1 year. Since MACRA requirements change annually, you’ll need to earn your certificate each year.
#### What are the advantages of opting into the QPP if our participation isn't required?
MIPS-eligible clinicians who voluntarily opt into MIPS gain an average 8.2% in Part B reimbursement, according to CMS. When you consider an extra 8.2% on every Part B item and service billed by a provider, the advantages are clear. For example, a potential annual Medicare reimbursement of $100,000 becomes $118,000. Additionally, clinicians who voluntarily report their data receive a feedback report from CMS, allowing them to see how their performance may affect future payments.
#### Do hospitals need to know about MACRA?
70% of physicians are now in hospital-owned practices. Hospitals that are concerned with Medicare Part B payments and practice costs should understand the implications of MACRA.
#### We work at a risk adjustment Medicare Advantage Plan–do we need this information?
MACRA primarily affects Part B clinicians. MA plans will need to understand the implications of MACRA changes.
#### Is MACRA here to stay?
MACRA passed with bipartisan support and will endure as a catalyst for ongoing improvements in the quality of U.S. healthcare.
