# RHC Venipuncture Policy
A venipuncture is a covered Rural Health Center (RHC) service, and is not reported separately from the encounter. It is an incident-to service and the venipuncture cost incurred providing laboratory services is included in the all-inclusive rate ([[RHC All Inclusive Rate (AIR)|AIR]]). 

The amount is part of the encounter charge since it is provided during that visit. View requirements in the [CMS Internet Only Manual (IOM), Publication, 100-02, Chapter 13, Section 60.1](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/bp102c13.pdf)
