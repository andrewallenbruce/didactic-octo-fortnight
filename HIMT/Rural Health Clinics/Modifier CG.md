# Modifier CG
Effective October 1, 2016.

Noridian accepts modifier CG on Rural Health Clinics (RHC) claims and claim adjustments.

### Correct Use

-   RHCs must report modifier CG on one revenue code 052x and/or 0900 service line per day, which includes all charges subject to coinsurance and deductible for the visit. RHCs should report all services furnished during visit on one claim

For RHCs, the coinsurance is 20 percent of the charges. Therefore, coinsurance and deductible will be based on the charges reported on the revenue code 052x and/or 0900 service line with modifier CG. RHCs will continue to be paid an all-inclusive rate ([[RHC All Inclusive Rate (AIR)|AIR]]) per visit.

Charges for the additional service lines are packaged/bundled in the qualifying visit service line and displayed on the line for the specific service. Medicare does not pay or adjudicate the total line (0001 revenue code). Payment is based on the qualifying visit line.
