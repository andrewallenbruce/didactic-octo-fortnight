# 20.1 - Per Visit Payment and Exceptions under the AIR
*(Rev. 3434, Issued: 12-31-15, Effective: 03-31-16, Implementation: 03-31-16)* 

RHCs and FQHCs are paid an [[RHC All Inclusive Rate (AIR)|AIR]] per visit, except for FQHCs that have transitioned to the [[Medicare]] Prospective Payment System (PPS). 

For RHCs and FQHCs billing under the AIR, more than one medically-necessary face-to-face visit with a RHC or FQHC practitioner on the same day is payable as one visit, except for the following circumstances:

- The patient, subsequent to the first visit, suffers an illness or injury that requires additional diagnosis or treatment on the same day, (for example, a patient sees their practitioner in the morning for a medical condition and later in the day has a fall and returns to the RHC/FQHC)

- The patient has a medical visit and a mental health visit on the same day;

- The patient has an Initial Preventive Physical Examination (IPPE) and a separate qualified medical and/or mental health visit on the same day;

- The patient has a Diabetes Self-Management Training (DSMT) or Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) visit on the same day as an otherwise payable medical visit. DSMT and MNT apply to FQHCs only.
