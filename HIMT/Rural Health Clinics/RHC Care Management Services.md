# RHC Care Management Services
Care management services are structured services in addition to any routine care coordination services already furnished as a Rural Health Clinic (RHC) visit. RHCs can only bill one care management service for an individual per month.

Care Management Services include:

-   Transitional care management (TCM)
-   Chronic care management (CCM)
-   General behavioral health integration (BHI)
-   Psychiatric Collaborative Care Model (CoCM)

The patient must meet the criteria and benefit from care management services as determined by the primary care physician, nurse practitioner (NP), physician assistant (PA) or certified nurse midwife (CNM).Â 

These services require general supervision, the RHC practitioner does not have to be in the same building or immediately available; however, it does require the services to be furnished under the RHC practitioner's overall supervision and control.

### Billing and Reimbursement

Coinsurance (20% of billed charges) and deductible apply to care management services in the RHC. HCPCS G0511 and G0512 will be reimbursed from the national non-facility Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) rate.

### Tips

Avoid duplicative payment for care management services when provided by another facility or practitioner during the same service period. For example, home health care supervision, hospice care supervision or certain ESRD services.

The evaluation and management (E/M), Annual Wellness Visit (AWV), or Initial Preventive Physical Examination (IPPE) initial service or visit with the patient is separately paid and the time cannot be counted towards the required time for billing HCPCS G0511 or G0512.
