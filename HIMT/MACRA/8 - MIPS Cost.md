# MIPS Cost
In year 5, Cost will be calculated at 20 percent of the MIPS final score. The weight for this performance category will increase to 30 percent of the MIPS final score for year 6 (performance year 2022/payment year 2024), as required by MACRA.

Cost is based on resource use. CMS will use normalized costs across the country by eliminating regional wage indices, as well as removing disproportionate share payments and medical education costs from hospital and facility fees. This allows CMS to measure the number and intensity of services, tests, and treatments provided to beneficiaries. The result is expressed in dollars compared to expected expenditures nationally for each measure.

There were no changes to the 2020 measure methodology. The Cost performance category measures for 2021 performance year are:

- Total per Capita Cost measure
- Medicare Spending per Beneficiary Clinician (MSPB-C)
- 18 existing episode-based measures

CMS is adding telehealth services directly applicable to existing episode-based code measures and the TPCC measure.

Data is collected through administrative claims data; clinicians do not need to submit any further data for calculation. All claims have trigger codes, which CMS uses to decide if a case falls in or out of a given formula. For Cost measures, the calculation includes those patients that CMS attributes to the clinician.

## Total Per Capita Cost (TPCC)
This formula looks at the overall cost of a patient’s care for both Medicare Parts A and B for a given year. Total per Capita Cost measures the total yearly costs for all patients assigned to a provider, divided by the total number of patients assigned to that provider. Beginning in 2020, TPCC attribution requires E/M services to have an associated primary care service or a follow-up E/M service from the same clinician group. TPCC attribution excludes certain clinicians who primarily deliver certain non-primary care services. The clinician must have at least 20 cases for the measure to be applicable.

## Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary Clinician (MSPB-C)
This resource use measure is triggered by acute care episodes related to hospitalizations. The measure includes all Parts A and B payments beginning two days prior to hospitalization and lasting for 30 days following hospitalization. The clinician must have at least 35 cases for the measure to be applicable.

Cost measures are available for download at https://qpp.cms.gov/mips/cost.

## Episode-Based Cost Measures
These measures are based on services provided to a patient
during a particular episode of care. Eight episode-based Cost measures were added in year 3. CMS advises providers to access and review their field test reports to gain understanding.

Patients are attributed to a clinician’s claims submission information. CMS gives the following examples in the *Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS): Episode-Based Cost Measure Field Test Reports (October 2017) Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)*:

- The attributed clinician is identified by unique Taxpayer Identification Number/National Provider Identifier (TIN-NPI) informed by the performing NPI field on the physician/supplier Part B (carrier) claim.
- For procedural episode groups, episodes are attributed to the clinician(s) rendering the trigger services (HCPCS/CPT® procedure codes).
	- For example, an orthopedic surgeon billing CPT® code 27446 would be attributed a knee arthroplasty episode.
- For acute inpatient medical condition episode groups, episodes are attributed to the clinician(s) rendering at least 30 percent of inpatient evaluation and management (E/M) services during an inpatient hospitalization with the medical Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups (MS-DRGs) for the episode group.
	- For example, a neurologist billing 30 percent of inpatient E/M codes on Part B physician/supplier claims concurrent to an inpatient hospitalization with MS-DRG code 065 would be attributed an intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral infarction episode.

In some cases, the cost of care may be attributed to more than one physician. The use of patient relationship codes ensures the attribution of patients and care episodes to clinicians who serve patients in different roles. Patient relationship codes distinguish the relationship and responsibility of a clinician with a patient at the time of service. To ensure CMS properly attributes Cost measures, MIPS eligible clinicians should append the following HCPCS Level II modifiers to procedure codes, as applicable:

- **X1** Continuous/Broad Services
- **X2** Continuous/Focused Services
- **X3** Episodic/Broad Services
- **X4** Episodic/Focused Services
- **X5** Only as ordered by another clinician

There is a case minimum of 10 for procedural episodes and a case minimum of 20 for acute inpatient medical condition episodes.

For procedural episodes, CMS will attribute episodes to each MIPS eligible clinician who renders a trigger service (identified by procedure codes).

For acute inpatient medical condition episodes, CMS will attribute episodes to each MIPS eligible clinician who bills inpatient E/M claim lines during a trigger inpatient hospitalization under a TIN that renders at least 30 percent of the inpatient E/M claim lines in that hospitalization.

A couple of notes about the Cost performance category:
- If only one performance category can be scored, it will serve as the performance category score. If there is insufficient data to score Cost, CMS will assign 0 percent.
- There is no improvement scoring as of year 3.

## Facility-Based Quality and Cost Performance Measures
New in year 3, the election to report facility-based quality and cost measures automatically applies to MIPS eligible clinicians and groups who would benefit by having a higher combined Quality and Cost performance category score.

There are no data submission requirements for the Quality and Cost performance categories for individual clinicians and groups in facility-based measurement.

### Who Qualifies?
Individual MIPS eligible clinicians who furnish 75 percent or more of their covered professional services in an inpatient hospital (Place of Service code 21), on-campus outpatient hospital (22), or emergency room (ER) (23), based on claims for a period prior to the performance period.

Clinicians are required to have at least a single service billed with an inpatient hospital or ER POS code.

A facility-based clinician is attributed to the hospital at which they provide services to the most Medicare patients, or the value-based purchasing score for the highest scoring facility. If CMS is unable to attribute a clinician’s performance, that clinician must participate in MIPS using a different method.

An individual or group must submit data in the Improvement
Activities or Promoting Interoperability performance categories to be scored under facility-based measurement.

### The Cost performance category percent score formula is:

Cost performance category percent score =
