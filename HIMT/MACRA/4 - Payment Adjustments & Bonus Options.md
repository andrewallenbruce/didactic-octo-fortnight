# Payment Adjustments & Bonus Options
The timeline for QPP performance and payment [[Adjustments]] spans three years. For example:

| Performance Year | Submission/Feedback Year | Payment Year |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ------------ |
| 2020             | 2021                     | 2022         |


Clinicians collect data during the performance year; submit the data to [[CMS]] between January 1 and March 31 the following year, receive performance feedback by July that year; and receive payment adjustments based on performance the following year. 

Scheduled MIPS payment adjustments and potential bonuses for Qualifying APM Participants (QP) and Partial Qualifying APM Participants (PQP) in an Advanced APM are shown in the table below.

When a clinician has multiple final scores associated with a single TIN/NPI combination, CMS will use a virtual group final score first to determine the 2023 payment year MIPS payment adjustment and the highest available final score from the APM entity, group, or individual second. This is changed from 2022 payment year policy, in which the APM entity final score will be considered first.

## Performance Threshold
To receive a neutral payment adjustment to [[Medicare]] Part B claims in 2023, MIPS eligible clinicians will need to earn a final score of 60 points, the performance threshold for year 5. This is a change from the 45-point threshold in year 4. The additional performance threshold for exceptional performance is 85 points (up from 80 points in 2020). Note, however, that year 4 was the final year for additional positive adjustments for exceptional performance.

## Budget Neutral
MIPS is budget neutral, which means CMS takes the money it saves from providers who receive reductions to pay for provider who receive increases. The maximum upward adjustment is capped at three times the maximum negative adjustment.

## Bonus Points
CMS discontinued awarding measure bonus points to CMS Web Interface reporters for reporting high priority measures in performance year 2019. Beginning in 2019 and through the 2023 MIPS payment year, the total measure bonus points for high priority measures cannot exceed 10 percent of the total available measure achievement points.

Beginning with payment year 2023, bonus points for the Query of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP) measure are increased from 5 points to 10 points, based on 2021 performance.

## Complex Patient Bonus
CMS will apply a complex patient bonus capped at 5 points to the final score for the 2021 MIPS performance period/2023 MIPS payment year. Complexity is measured through hierarchical condition category (HCC) risk scores and social risk as measured through the proportion of patients with dual eligible status.

HCC risk scores are calculated annually, based on the following information from the calendar year:

- Patient’s age and gender
- Patient’s eligibility for [[Medicaid]], disabled, or lives in an institution
- Patient’s diagnoses

## Formulas to calculate the bonuses:

### MIPS eligible participants:
==the average HCC risk score assigned to beneficiaries seen by the MIPS eligible clinician or seen by clinicians in a group== **+** ==the dual eligible ratio== **x** ==5==

### APM entities:
==the [[Beneficiary]] weighted average HCC risk score for all MIPS eligible clinicians, and if technically feasible, TINs for models and virtual groups which rely on complete
TIN participation within the APM entity or virtual group, respectively== **+** ==the average dual eligible ratio for all MIPS eligible clinicians, and if technically feasible, TINs for models and virtual groups which rely on complete TIN participation, within the APM entity or virtual group, respectively== **x** ==5==

Note: The QPP is budget neutral so all figures are variable, depending on the number of providers sharing the $500 million MACRA provided for this purpose.
