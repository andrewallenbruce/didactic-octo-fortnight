# MIPS Overview
There are four performance categories in MIPS, linked by their connection to quality and value of patient care. In most cases, eligible clinicians are scored in all four categories and a MIPS composite, or final, score determines their [[Medicare]] Part B payment [[Adjustments]]. Year 5 performance categories and weights in the final score are: ^[Resource Library - QPP (https://qpp.cms.gov/about/resource-library)]

| Quality | Cost | Promoting Interoperability | Improvement Activities |
|:-------:|:----:|:--------------------------:|:----------------------:|
|   40    |  20  |             25             |           15           |

Although the Quality performance category started out as the heavy hitter in MIPS, by payment year 2024, it must be evenly weighted with the Cost performance category, per MACRA.

| Pymt Year | Quality | Promoting Interoperability | Improvement Activities | Cost |
|:---------:|:-------:|:--------------------------:|:----------------------:|:----:|
|   2019    |   60%   |            25%             |          15%           |  0%  |
|   2020    |   50%   |            25%             |          15%           | 10%  |
|   2021    |   45%   |            25%             |          15%           | 15%  |
|   2022    |   45%   |            25%             |          15%           | 15%  |
|   2023    |   40%   |            25%             |          15%           | 20%  |
|   2024    |   30%   |            25%             |          15%           | 30%  |

These weights do not apply to the APP. Performance category weights for APM entities reporting traditional MIPS for the 2021 performance period is as follows:

- Quality: 50%
- Cost: 0%
- Promoting Interoperability: 30%
- Improvement Activities: 20%

## Individual Versus Group Reporting
Eligible clinicians can choose to report as a group or individually. If clinicians collectively submit their MIPS data as a group, each eligible clinician in the group will receive the same payment adjustment based on the group’s final score. Groups are defined by a single TIN; whereas, individuals are defined at the TIN/NPI level. Beginning with performance year 2018, [[CMS]] will treat virtual groups as standard groups.

## Data Submission
There are several methods for reporting MIPS performance data. Groups have options not available to individual reporters and vice versa. Quality measures also dictate submission methods.

### Individual MIPS Data Submission Options:
1. Medicare Part B [[Claim Form|claims]] – Quality – Add Quality Data Codes (QDCs) to denominator-eligible claims.
2. Qualified Clinical Data Registry (QCDR) – Quality, Improvement Activities, Promoting Interoperability – Specialty associations approved to offer additional quality measures. Contact the association for the cost.
3. MIPS Clinical Quality Measures (CQM)
4. eCQM (electronic CQM)
5. 2015 Edition Certified Electronic Health Record Technology (CEHRT) – Quality, Improvement Activities, Promoting Interoperability – Similar to 2016 PQRS and Meaningful Use (MU) reporting.

### Group Reporting Options (including Virtual Groups):
1. QCDR – Quality, Improvement Activities, Promoting Interoperability – Specialty associations approved to offer additional quality measures. Contact the association for cost.
2. MIPS CQM/eCQM – Quality, Improvement Activities, Promoting Interoperability.
3. CEHRT Edition 2015 – Quality, Improvement Activities, Promoting Interoperability – Similar to 2016 PQRS and MU reporting.
4. Medicare Part B claims measures
5. CMS Web Interface - (groups with 25 or more clinicians) – Quality – To submit Quality measures data through this mechanism, your group must register by June 30 of the performance year. Note: The CMS Web Interface will sunset with the 2022 performance period. For 2021, groups and virtual groups may use this as a collection type and submission type. 
6. Administrative claims – Cost performance categories are evaluated using data submitted through routine billing. No data submission is required.
7. Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) for MIPS survey – Quality – CMS-approved survey vendor that collects and submits data about the experience of care at the practice on behalf of the group.

There are a number of ways a clinician can reach the 60-point threshold in 2021. Remember: Small practices already have a 6-point lead; and the complex patient bonus is worth up to an additional 5 points. CMS gives these examples for how to reach the threshold:

- Report all required Improvement Activities measures
- Meet the Promoting Interoperability base score and submit one quality measure that meets data completeness
- Meet the Promoting Interoperability base score by reporting the five base measures, and submit one medium-weighted improvement activity
- Submit six quality measures that meet data completeness criteria.

*IMPORTANT NOTE IF YOU ARE SUBMITING DATA VIA CLAIMS:* You will be able to tell if your quality reporting data has been accepted when you see the remittance advice from Medicare code **N620**. However, this code doesn’t tell you that the code was appropriate — just that it was received. This reporting option is only available to individuals, not to groups or virtual groups.

For year 5, the second 12-month segment of the MIPS determination period (Oct. 1, 2020, to Sept. 30, 2021, will be used when calculating average HCC risk scores and the proportion of full benefit or partial benefit dual eligible beneficiaries for MIPS eligible clinicians.

### Note these newer terms:
**Collection Type:** A set of quality measures with comparable specifications and data completeness criteria (e.g., claims measures, registry measures, etc.). CMS revised this definition for year 5 to remove CMS Web Interface as of year 6.

**Submitter Type:** The entity participating in MIPS

**Submission Type:** The mechanism by which the submitter type submits data to CMS, including: direct, log in and upload, log in and attest, Medicare Part B claims, and the CMS Web Interface. CMS revised this definition for year 5 to remove CMS Web Interface as of year 6.

## MIPS Value Pathways
CMS finalized a MIPS Value Pathways (MVP) framework in the 2020 QPP final rule with the intention of implementing it beginning with the 2021 performance period. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, CMS is waiting until at least 2022 to implement MVPs.

The MVP framework will connect measures and activities across the four MIPS performance categories, incorporate a set of administrative claims-based quality measures that focus on population health, provide data and feedback to clinicians, and enhance information provided to patients.

Once implemented, MVPs will wholly change the MIPS program, including the way in which MIPS eligible clinicians are scored. CMS anticipates that they will be able to score quality measures from 1 to 10 for measures in MVPs and, as such, will revisit and possibly remove the 3-point floor for traditional MIPS in future years.
