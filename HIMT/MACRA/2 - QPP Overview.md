# QPP Overview
The bedrock of the **Quality Payment Program** is “high-value, patient-centered care, informed by useful feedback, in a continuous cycle of improvement.” 1^[Quality Payment Program Year 2 Final Rule: www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/11/16/2017-24067/medicare-program-cy-2018-updates-to-the-quality-payment-program-and-quality-paymentprogram-extreme]
# Quality Payment Program
Quality care is tied to medical coding and medical coding is tied to reimbursement. The days of siloed expertise is a thing of the past and we must understand how each area of revenue cycle management (RCM) affects the next. Coders have a unique ability to understand how RCM works for both the physician and payer. To have a coder on the team who also understands the QPP is essential for clinicians who wish to receive full credit for the quality care they provide to patients. 

## The QPP is comprised of two payment methodologies:
### - Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS)
### - Advanced Alternative Payment Models (APMs)

Although there are two separate pathways within the QPP, both Advanced APMs and MIPS contribute toward the goal of seamless integration of the QPP into clinical practice workflows: Advanced APMs promote seamless integration by way of payment methodology and design that incentivize care coordination; and MIPS builds on the capacity of eligible clinicians to participate in APMs in later years of the QPP5.

## Year 1 of QPP
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) published a final rule in 2016 to establish special policies for year 1 (performance year 2017/payment year 2019) of the QPP.

The Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) and Alternative Payment Model (APM) Incentive under the Physician Fee Schedule, and Criteria for Physician-Focused Payment Models final rule (81 FR 77008, Nov. 4, 2016), or 2017 QPP
final rule, established:

- Incentives for participation in Advanced APMs;
- The definition and processes for Qualifying APM Participants (QPs) in Advanced APMs;
- Criteria for use of the Physician-Focused Payment Model Technical Advisory Committee (PTAC); and
- Policies to phase in the implementation of MIPS.

## Year 2 of QPP
The 2018 QPP final rule further implemented policies established
in the 2017 QPP final rule, and addressed elements of MACRA that were not included in the first year of the program, including:

- Virtual groups
- 2019 performance period facility-based measurement
- Improvement scoring

Added flexibilities were offered to small practices to alleviate
perceived burden and several bonus opportunities were added
to encourage participation.

### Automatic Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances
2017 was a memorable year. Hurricanes tore through entire communities in Florida and Puerto Rico and fires blazed through California, leaving entire communities without water, electricity, and shelter.

CMS released an interim final rule 6 concurrently with the 2018 QPP final rule to establish an automatic extreme and uncontrollable circumstance policy for year 1 of MIPS to recognize the 2017 hurricanes and other natural disasters that impeded many MIPS eligible clinicians’ ability to participate in the QPP. 

In short, CMS applied the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policies for all MIPS eligible clinicians in affected areas without requiring an application to be submitted. These MIPS eligible clinicians received a final score equal to the 2017 performance threshold.

## Year 3 of QPP
A third final rule, published in the Nov. 23, 2018, Federal Register, further implemented MACRA mandates and revised several previously finalized policies for year 3 (performance year 2019/payment year 2021) of the QPP.

Notable changes included:
 - An expanded list of eligible clinician types
- An opt-in to MIPS option
- A third criterion to the low-volume threshold calculation
- Weight changes to the Quality and Cost performance categories

According to CMS7, 99.99 percent of eligible clinicians participated in MIPS in 2019 with 954,614 eligible clinicians receiving a payment adjustment. Of those who received a payment adjustment, 97.6 percent received a positive payment adjustment for payment year 2021 based on their performance in 2019. 

Also, for the 2019 performance period, CMS reports that 195,564 eligible clinicians earned Qualifying APM Participant (QP) status, while another 27,995 eligible clinicians earned partial QP status.

Due to the public health emergency (PHE) for the COVID-19 pandemic, CMS reports that 65,237 (approximately 6.83 percent of 954,614) MIPS eligible clinicians received
reweighting of one or more MIPS performance categories for year 3 under the MIPS Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances policy.

## Year 4 of QPP
The 2020 QPP final rule, published in the Nov. 15, 2019, Federal Register, continued to phase in previously finalized policies for year 4 (performance year 2020/payment year 2022) and introduced a radical change to how clinicians will select measures in the future.

Notable changes to the QPP for year 4 include:
- Weight changes to the Quality and Cost performance categories
- Payment threshold changes
- Payment adjustment changes
- Definition of hospital-based clinicians
- Proposed MIPS Value Pathways (MVP)

Due to the PHE for the COVID-19 pandemic, however, CMS finalized in the 2021 QPP final rule several changes to year 4 policy:
- An increase to the complex patient bonus. Clinicians, groups, virtual groups, and APM entities can earn up to 10 bonus points toward their final score for the 2020 performance year, only.
- APM entities may apply for reweighting of MIPS performance categories due to extreme and uncontrollable circumstances for the 2020 performance year, only. If approved, the APM entity will receive a score equal to the performance threshold.
- An extension for applying for reweighting due to extreme and uncontrollable circumstances for the 2019 performance period from Dec. 31, 2019, to Feb. 1, 2020.^[https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-26815.pdf]

In separate rulemaking^[Federal Register :: Additional Policy and Regulatory Revisions in Response to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency], CMS also added a new COVID-19 Clinical Trials improvement activity to the CY 2020 Improvement Activities inventory for use beginning with the 2020 performance period (85 FR 19276-19277 and 85 FR 54848-54851). This training will review the year 5 provisions of the QPP as finalized in the 2021 QPP final rule.^[https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-26815.pdf]
