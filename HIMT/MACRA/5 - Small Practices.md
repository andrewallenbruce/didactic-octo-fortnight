# Small Practices
Small practices face challenges in their ability to participate in MIPS. [[CMS]] encourages small practices to participate by subsidizing some of their infrastructure hurdles. CMS states in the 2018 QPP final rule, “The support of small, independent practices remains an important thematic objective for the implementation of the Quality Payment Program and is expected to be carried throughout future rulemaking.” 

> CMS defines small practices for the purposes of MIPS as 15 or fewer clinicians.

As in previous years, CMS continues to award 6 bonus points in the Quality performance category to MIPS eligible clinicians in small practices who submit data on at least one measure and 3 points for quality measures that don’t meet data completeness requirements. Additionally, clinicians in small practices may apply to have the Promoting Interoperability performance category reweighted to zero. Small practices also have reduced reporting requirements in the Improvement Activities
category:

- Medium-weighted activities are worth 20 points; and
- High-weighted activities are worth 40 points

CMS also offers free and customized resources available within local communities, including direct, one-on-one support from the Small, Underserved, and Rural Support Initiative, in addition to CMS’ other no-cost technical assistance.

Beginning with the 2019 performance period (year 3), only small practices — whether participating individually or as a group — may submit quality measures using [[Medicare]] Part B [[Claim Form|claims]] as a submission type.

Lastly, small practices may continue to participate in MIPS as a virtual group.

## Virtual Groups
Beginning with the 2019 performance period, clinicians may participate in MIPS as an individual, as a group, as an APM entity in a MIPS APM, or as a virtual group.

A virtual group is a combination of two or more TINs assigned to one or more solo practitioners or one or more groups consisting of 10 or fewer eligible clinicians that elect to form a virtual group for a performance period for a year.

If a group chooses to join a virtual group, all of the clinicians in that group are part of the virtual group. The group’s final score and resulting payment adjustment percentage applies to all clinicians in the virtual group.

The virtual group eligibility determination period aligns with the first period of data analysis under the MIPS eligibility determination period. For year 5, the determination period is Oct. 1, 2019, to Sept. 30, 2020 (including a 30-day claims run out).

## Eligibility
A virtual group election is considered a low-volume threshold opt-in for any prospective member of the virtual group that exceeds at least one, but not all three, of the low-volume threshold criteria. Clinicians can only participate in one virtual group per performance period.

There is no limit on the size of a virtual group ^[42 CFR Part 414 § II.C.4]. Virtual groups are held to the same requirements for each performance category as standard groups, and are responsible for aggregating data for their measures and activities across the virtual group.

TINs can inquire about their TIN size prior to making an election during a 3-month time frame, which begins Oct. 1 and ends Dec. 31 of the calendar year prior to the applicable performance period.

## Election Process
***There is a two-stage election process for virtual groups:***

### Stage 1 (optional)
If you’re a solo practitioner or part of a group with 10 or fewer eligible clinicians:

- Make any formal written agreements.
- Send in your formal election registration.
- Budget your resources for your virtual group.

### Stage 2 (required)
The virtual group must have a formal agreement between each solo practitioner and group that composes the virtual group prior to submitting an election to CMS. Each virtual group must name an official representative who is responsible for submitting the virtual group’s election. Elections must be submitted via e-mail to MIPS_VirtualGroup@cms.hhs.gov by December 31 of the preceding year you intend to operate as a virtual group.

The data submission criteria applicable to groups are also generally applicable to virtual groups, except for data completeness and sampling requirements for the CMS Web Interface and CAHPS for MIPS survey:

- Data completeness for virtual groups applies cumulatively across all TINs in a virtual group. There may be a case when a virtual group has one TIN that falls below the 60 percent data completeness threshold, which is an acceptable case as long as the virtual group cumulatively exceeds such threshold.

- The CMS Web Interface and CAHPS for MIPS survey sampling requirements pertain to Medicare Part B patients with respect to all TINs in a virtual group, where the sampling methodology will be conducted for each TIN within the virtual group and then cumulatively aggregated across the virtual group. A virtual group would need to meet the [[Beneficiary]] sampling threshold cumulatively as a virtual group ^[Help and Support - QPP (https://qpp.cms.gov/about/help-and-support)]
