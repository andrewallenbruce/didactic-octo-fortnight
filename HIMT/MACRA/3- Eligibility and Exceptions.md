# Eligibility and Exceptions
Not every healthcare provider is required to participate in the Quality Payment Program (QPP). First and foremost, payment [[Adjustments]] only apply to professional services paid under [[Medicare]] Part B, so providers who don’t accept Medicare Part B are excluded.

# MIPS Eligible Clinicians in 2021
For the 2018 performance year, the CMS defined eligible clinicians — identified by a unique billing Tax Identification Number (TIN) and [[HIMT/Glossary/National Provider Identifier|National Provider Identifier]] (NPI) combination — as any of the following healthcare professionals:^[Federal Register :: Medicare Program; CY 2018 Updates to the Quality Payment Program; and Quality Payment Program: Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstance Policy for the Transition Year]

- Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNA)
- Clinical Nurse Specialists (CNS)
- Doctors of Chiropractic (DC)
- Doctors of Dental Medicine (DMD)
- Doctors of Dental Surgery (DDS)
- Doctors of Medicine (MD)
- Doctors of Optometry (OD)
- Doctors of Osteopathy (DO)
- Doctors of Podiatric Medicine (DPM)
- Nurse Practitioners (NP)
- Physician Assistants (PA)

For performance year 2019, CMS expanded this list to include the following eligible clinicians for the purposes of MIPS participation:

- Clinical Psychologists
- Physical Therapists
- Occupational Therapists
- Qualified Speech-Language Pathologists
- Qualified Audiologists
- Registered Dietitian or Nutrition Professionals

This list is unchanged for year 5 (performance year 2021/payment year 2023).

All MIPS eligible clinicians, including those in a MIPS APM, may participate in MIPS as an individual, group, virtual group, or (new for 2021) an APM entity.

## 2021 Low Volume Threshold
The above-listed clinician types are automatically considered eligible clinicians if they meet or exceed the low-volume threshold. Beginning with performance year 2019, a MIPS eligible clinician:

- Earns greater than $90,000 in Medicare Part B allowed charges; and
- Earns greater than 200 Medicare Part B patients; and
- Provides greater than 200 covered professional services under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS).

[[CMS]] estimates approximately 228,000 clinicians will be MIPS eligible because they exceed the low volume threshold as individuals and are not otherwise excluded. CMS identifies these clinicians as having “required eligibility.” Of those required to participate, CMS estimates 27,115 (10%) will choose not to participate.

As in performance year 2020, eligible clinicians who do not meet all three criteria are excluded from MIPS but may voluntarily report. Voluntary reporters do not receive payment adjustments and their performance results will not be published on the CMS [Physician Compare](http://www.medicare.gov/physiciancompare/) website if they choose to opt out. The advantage of voluntary reporting is to generate feedback reports the clinician/group can use to prepare for future participation in the QPP; it also helps CMS improve the accuracy of benchmarks used to evaluate measures.

Beginning in 2019, eligible clinicians who meet at least one criterion (but not all three) may opt-in to MIPS. For example, an eligible clinician who receives $90,000 in allowed Medicare charges but sees fewer than 200 patients and provides fewer than 200 professional services may opt-in to MIPS. Those who opt in are considered MIPS eligible clinicians and will receive payment adjustments based on performance.

MIPS eligibility is based on two consecutive 12-month lookback periods that align with the fiscal year, beginning on Oct. 1. For 2021, the two determination periods are Oct. 1, 2019, to Sept. 30, 2020, and Oct. 1, 2020, to Sept. 30, 2021. Eligibility for the upcoming performance period is based on only the first 12-month period.

An eligible clinician may also be excluded from MIPS payment adjustments if one or more of the following is true:
- The clinician is a Medicare freshman.
- The clinician is a Qualifying APM Participant (QP) or Partial QP (PQP) in an Advanced APM (defined later).

## Significant Hardships
There are automatic exclusions (based on the low volume threshold) from MIPS and then there are exceptions, which may or may not require application. For example, MIPS eligible clinicians without access to certified electronic health record technology (CEHRT) due to a significant hardship, such as decertification of their electronic health record (EHR), can apply to have the [[Promoting Interoperability]] (formerly Advancing Care Information) category reweighted to zero (the weight is then transferred to the Quality performance category).

For performance year 2018, CMS added a significant hardship exception from the Promoting Interoperability performance category for MIPS eligible clinicians in small practices. To apply for a significant hardship for performance year 2021, clinicians had to submit a significant hardship application to CMS by Dec. 31, 2020.

CMS makes other exceptions for small practices, practices located in rural areas; non-patient-facing individual MIPS eligible clinicians or groups; and individual MIPS eligible clinicians and groups that participate in a MIPS APM or a patient-centered medical home.

To date, CMS has not imposed a time limitation for the number of years a clinician can apply for a significant hardship exception.

## Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances
For the 2021 performance period, there are no changes to this policy for individual clinicians, groups, and virtual groups. However, beginning with the 2020 performance period, APM entities may also apply for reweighting of all MIPS performance categories. APM entity groups will receive a score equal to the performance threshold even if data are submitted. As in previous years, however, individual clinicians, groups, and virtual groups that submit data override the approved reweighting on a category-by-category basis.

For performance years 2021 and 2022, the minimum Quality performance score for an ACO affected by an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance during the performance year will be set equal to the 30th percentile MIPS Quality performance category score. CMS states in the 2021 QPP final rule, “If an ACO is unable to report quality data and meet the MIPS Quality data completeness and case minimum requirement due to an extreme and uncontrollable circumstance, we will apply the 30th percentile MIPS Quality performance category score.”

Note: CMS states in the 2021 MPFS final rule that it anticipates the PHE for COVID-19 to continue into and through CY 2021. As such, the extreme and uncontrollable circumstances policy will be available for the 2021 performance period.

Remember: if a clinician, group, or virtual group submits data for the 2021 performance period, the data submission overrides the application and the clinician, group, or virtual group will be scored on the data submitted.

## How are MIPS “ineligible” clinicians affected by MACRA?
### Revenue
A clinician who is not eligible to participate in MIPS is not subject to MIPS payment adjustments — good or bad. However, clinicians who voluntarily report data will receive a feedback report from CMS, allowing them to see how their performance may affect future payments.

### Marketing
CMS allows a 30-day “opt-out” period for low-volume eligible clinicians to voluntarily submit data and not have the information become public. Unfortunately, they will not know how they did and whether they should opt out for several months later, when CMS releases performance feedback.

## How are MIPS eligible clinicians affected?
### Marketing
CMS will publish MIPS eligible clinicians’ performance scores on its [Physician Compare](<[Physician Compare](http://www.medicare.gov/physiciancompare/) website>) website. This free website is used by patients and consumer rating websites. Exceptional performers will benefit from this free advertising. The same cannot be said for underperformers.

CMS will publish final scores a year after data is reported, giving clinicians time to preview their performance data and, if appropriate, request a targeted review before it is made public. Clinicians will be rated on a scale of 0 to 100 and how they compare to peers nationally. A 2014 JAMA study found that 65 percent of consumers are aware of online physician rating sites and 36 percent of consumers have used a ratings site at least once. High performance scores and ratings can become a strategic marketing advantage for providers over their competitors who have low or no scores.

### Future Options to Join a Group
If a clinician’s MIPS performance feedback scores are low, their ability to join a new group or hospital may be compromised. Potential employers will not want to inherit a clinician’s low score and risk lowering their score.

### Revenue
Both tracks in the QPP have levels of financial risks and rewards.
