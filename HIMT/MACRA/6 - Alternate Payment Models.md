# Alternate Payment Models
An Alternate Payment Model (APM) is a payment approach that gives clinicians added incentive payments for providing high-quality and cost-efficient care. APMs can apply to a specific clinical condition, a care episode, or a population. There are several alternate payment approaches that provide added incentives and downside risk to clinicians related to cost efficient care, which qualify as an APM.

- Pay-for-Performance
- Bundled Payment
- Shared Savings Programs
- [[Accountable Care Organizations]] (ACO)
- Patient Centered Medical Homes

# Advanced APM Model
Advanced APMs are [[CMS]] approved *subsets* of APMs that have met specific criteria. Approved models are listed at: https://qpp.cms.gov/apms/overview. Advanced APMs must require participants to:

1. Use CEHRT (at least 75 percent of the entity’s eligible clinicians must use CEHRT

2. Provide payment for covered professional services based on quality measures comparable to those used in the MIPS Quality performance category (including at least one outcome measure, if applicable)

3. Either be a Medical Home Model expanded under CMS Innovation Center authority or require participants to bear a significant financial risk.

Advanced APM entities must accept financial risk that their actual expenditures for patient care do not exceed expected expenditures. An Advanced APM entity may accomplish this by withholding provider payments, reducing provider rates, or paying [[CMS]] back. The Medical Home Model includes risk of 2.5 percent of [[Medicare]] Parts A and B revenue. All other models are 8 percent of the estimated average total Medicare Part A and B revenues of participating APM entities, or 3 percent of the expected expenditures for which an APM entity is responsible under the APM.

Advanced APMs require applications for participation to be submitted before the start of a performance year. Most APMs entities allow clinicians to join throughout the year. It is important to understand the existing regulations for the APM the clinician will be joining.

## APM Entities
APM entities^[42 CFR § 414.1305 - Definitions. | CFR | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute (https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/42/414.1305)] are organizations that participate with the Advanced APM or other APMs. Clinicians and their associated tax IDs (TINs) may join an existing APM entity or create a new APM entity (but must adhere to application deadlines, which can be annually or every several years). An APM entity is a group of eligible clinicians participating in an APM,
as identified by a combination of the APM identifier, APM entity identifier, TIN, and NPI for each participating eligible clinician.

## Participating Providers
Advanced APM participating providers are eligible clinicians and clinician groups that have applied and been accepted to participate in a qualified Advanced APM. Actuarial reviewed data is suggested before making the decision to minimize unexpected risks.

CMS recognizes clinicians as Qualifying APM Participants (QPs) if they appear on the Provider List Snapshot, reviewed on March 31, June 30, August 31, and for Medicare Shared Savings Program participants, December 31. Clinicians who are not participating in an APM during these snapshots must submit data to MIPS using the MIPS individual/group option to avoid a negative payment adjustment. MIPS APM special scoring may apply.

Beginning in 2019, CMS allows for QP determinations under the All-Payer Option to be requested at the TIN level, in addition to the APM entity and individual eligible clinician levels, when all eligible clinicians who have reassigned their billing rights to the TIN are included in a single APM entity. 

The All-Payer Combination Option allows eligible clinicians to become QPs by meeting the QP payment amount or patient count threshold through a pair of calculations that assesses a combination of both Medicare Part B covered professional services furnished through Advanced APMs and services furnished through Other Payer Advanced APMs.

## Attributable Beneficiaries
Scores are based on how many patients are attributed to the APM entity versus attributable beneficiaries. Attributable beneficiaries are the universe of beneficiaries that could be attributed to the APM entity. These are patients who are: 

1. not enrolled in HCC MA or a Medicare cost plan
2. do not have MSP
3. are enrolled in both Parts A and B
4. are at least 18 years of age
5. are U.S. residents; and 
6. have a minimum of one E/M visit or other qualified service under the rules of the APM

Physicians within the entity are incentivized to see patients more frequently who are attributed to them. APMs may have different rules on what constitutes a patient as attributed to an individual provider.

The definition of attribution is complicated because the same [[Beneficiary]] may be attributable for multiple eligible clinicians. For example, a patient who sees one physician for one problem and then another physician for a different problem could create confusion regarding who the patient officially belongs to on the attribution list. Nonetheless, APM entities have officially accepted the responsibility of cost and quality of care for the patients on their attribution list. 

CMS finalized for the 2021 QP performance period, that Medicare patients who have been attributed to an APM entity during a QP performance period will not be attributable Medicare patients for any APM entity that is participating in an APM that doesn’t allow such attributed Medicare patients to be attributed to another APM entity.

MIPS eligible clinicians can check their QP status using the QPP Participation Status Tool at [qpp.cms.gov](qpp.cms.gov) (EIDM credentials required). New for performance year 2021, CMS will accept targeted review requests for QP determinations under limited circumstances.

## Qualifying APM Participants (QP) for the 5% Bonus
As a QP, an eligible clinician is not subject to the MIPS reporting requirements and payment adjustment, and qualifies for a lump sum APM incentive payment equal to 5 percent of “the paid amount of the applicable claims for covered professional services that are subsequently aggregated to calculate the estimated aggregate payments,” CMS clarifies in the 2021 QPP final rule.

Contrary to what CMS finalized in the 2021 [[Medicare Physician Fee Schedule|MPFS]] final rule, the Consolidated Appropriations Bill of 2020 put a temporary freeze on the APM payment incentive thresholds, keeping them at 2020 levels for two more years (2021 and 2022). To achieve QP status in 2021, clinicians must receive at least 50 percent of Medicare Part B payments OR see at least 35 percent of Medicare patients through an Advanced APM entity.

The QP performance period is Jan. 1, 2021 – Aug. 31, 2021. During this period, CMS will take three snapshots to assess performance: March 31, June 30, and Aug. 31. QP determination is made approximately four months after the end of each snapshot date to allow for 60 days of claims run-out. The QP incentive payment base period is Jan. 1, 2022 – Dec. 31, 2022. Eligible clinicians who achieve QP status in 2021 will receive a 5 percent lump sum payment in 2023.

## Partial Qualified Participants - No Bonus
PQPs have the option to report under MIPS. If they do, they will be given extra MIPS APM credit in their scores, but no QP bonus. To achieve PQP status in 2021, clinicians must receive at least 40 percent of Medicare Part B payments OR see at least 25 percent of Medicare patients through an Advanced APM
entity.

CMS estimated that for the 2021 QP performance period, between 196,000 and 252,000 eligible clinicians would become QPs. That number will probably be much higher due to the APM threshold freeze.
