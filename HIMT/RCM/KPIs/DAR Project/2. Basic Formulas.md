<br>
## **Examples**
## Variables Used in Examples
To make the examples easier to follow and understand, we’ll use the same amounts to represent the variables needed in each example. They are as follows:

$n = 90$ Number of days in period
$x = 209,437.20$ Gross charges
$y = 90,756.28$ Ending AR balance
$c = 2327.08$ Average daily charge
$z = 39$ Days in AR
$a = {\text {Adjusted Days in AR}}$
$v_i = {\text {Segment of AR Balance}}$

###  Ending AR Balance Required for **$x$** DAR 
>This formula will allow you to calculate the dollar amount that the **Ending AR Balance** needs to be to achieve a **Days in AR** number of your choosing. Calculating this and the following formulas will provide you with a starting point for initial exploratory data analysis as to the causal factors of a high **Days in AR** figure. First, let's take a look at the variables that we need to define. Remember that the formula for **Days in AR** is:

$$z = \frac{y}{(x\div n)}$$

>Isolating $y$ (the variable for **Ending AR Balance**) to one side of the equation gives us:

$$y = \frac{zx}{n}$$

>In this case, we simply need to solve for **$y$** in the formula above. We'll use **`39`** days as the desired **Days in AR ($z$)**, **`$209,437.20`** as the **Gross Charges ($x$)**, and **`90`** as the **Number of Days in the Period ($n$)**, representing **Q1**, the first financial quarter of the year (non-leap year). Let's plug these numbers into our formula:

$$y = \frac{(39)209,437.20}{90}$$

>First, we'll multiply the **Days in AR** by the **Gross Charges** in the numerator, giving us:

$$y = \frac{8,168,064.06}{90}$$

>Now we only need to divide the numerator by the denominator to solve for $y$:

$$y = 90,756.28$$

>Therefore, if our desired number of **Days in AR** for **Q1** is **`39`**, our **Ending AR Balance** needs to be **`$90,756.28`**

### Average Daily Charge Required for **$x$** DAR
>This formula will allow you to calculate the dollar amount that the **Average Daily Charge** needs to be to achieve a **Days in AR** number of your choosing. Let's again take a look at the variables that we need to define. Remember that the formula for the **Average Daily Charge** is: <br>

$n = 90$ - Number of days in period
$x = 209,437.20$ Gross charges
$y = 90,756.28$ - Ending AR balance
$c = 2327.08$ - Average daily charge
$z = 39$ Days in AR

$$c = \frac{x}{n}$$

$$c = \frac{y}{z}$$

>And the formula for **Days in AR** is: <br>

$$z = \frac{y}{(x\div n)}$$ <br>

>Since they’re equal, we can substitute the denominator in the **Days in AR formula ($x\div n$)** with the variable for the **Average Daily Charge ($c$)**:

$$z = \frac{y}{c}$$ <br>

>We need to solve for $c$ in the formula above. We'll use the same figures from the first example for the variables that we know: **`39`** days as the desired **Days in AR ($z$)**, **`$90,756.12`** as the **Ending AR Balance ($y$)**, and **`90`** as the **Number of Days in the Period ($n$)**. Let's plug these numbers into our formula: <br>

$$39 = \frac{90,756.12}{c}$$ <br>

>To solve for $c$, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the **Ending AR Balance**: <br>

$$\frac{39}{90,756.12} = (\frac{90,756.12}{c})\div (\frac{1}{90,756.12})$$ <br>

>This gives us the following result for **$c$**:

$$c = 2,327.08$$

>Therefore, if our desired number of **Days in AR** for **Q1** is **`39`**, our **Average Daily Charge** needs to be **`$2,327.08`**

### Gross Charges Required for $x$ DAR
>This formula will allow you to calculate the dollar amount that the **Average Daily Charge** needs to be to achieve a **Days in AR** number of your choosing. Let's again take a look at the variables that we need to define. Remember that the formula for **Days in AR** is:

$$z = \frac{y}{(x\div n)}$$

>In this case, we need to solve for $x$ in the formula above. We'll use the same figures from the first example for the variables that we know: **`39`** days as the desired **Days in AR ($z$)**, **`$90,756.12`** as the **Ending AR Balance ($y$)**, and **`90`** as the **Number of Days in the Period ($n$)**, representing **Q1**, the first financial quarter of the year (non-leap year). Let's plug these numbers into our formula:

$$39 = \frac{90,756.12}{(x\div 90)}$$

>First, we'll divide the **Ending AR Balance** by the **Number of Days in the Period** to calculate the **Average Daily Charge**: 

$$39 = \frac{y}{2,327.08}$$

### DAR Segmentation for Cause Analysis Formula
The DAR metric is subject to many confounding variables that can obscure the true average number of days in AR. This formula is meant to segment the AR balance dollar amount to isolate those balances that can reasonably be expected to be collectible and remove those that need to be dealt with using a different methodology (i.e. patient aging older than 91 needing to be sent to collections, legitimate denials needing to be written off, etc.) Essentially, this formula will calculate the *adjusted* Days in AR.


$$z = \frac{y}{(x\div n)}$$
$$a = \frac{y - v_1 - v_2 - v_3...v_i}{(x\div n)}$$
