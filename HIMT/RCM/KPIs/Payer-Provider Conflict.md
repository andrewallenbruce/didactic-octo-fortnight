# Payer-Provider Conflict
#### *Do Providers Need to [[Audit]] Payers?*

A Sacramento-area surgeon couldn’t schedule surgeries for more than six months because his contract wasn’t loaded in the insurer’s computer system. More than 200 of a family practice physician’s patients received letters indicating incorrectly that he was no longer participating in the network; the physician lost about 25% of these patients and wasn’t paid for about eight months. 

An insured patient spent 11 months trying to get claims paid for his family, including an austistic child; the insurer never specified what information was needed to make the denied claims eligible for payment. The owners of healthcare practices easily recognize these painfully familiar symptoms. The question is: how are they related to the rising healthcare costs, and what can a provider do to help?

Exorbitant executive compensation has become a hallmark of the healthcare insurance industry. But such compensation can be easily justified to Wall Street when comparing it with outstanding insurance industry profits. The problem for any successful insurance company is how to make such growth sustainable. 

This question is difficult because the premium growth (68.4%) has disproportionately outpaced both inflation (16.4%) and workers’ earnings (18.2%) during the same period, making it impossible to continue to raise premiums without losing major segments of the insured population. 

Without the ability to attract new clients or further raise insurance premiums, cost reduction becomes the next most important approach for insurance companies to enhance profitability. Such cost reduction can be done in a variety of ways, divided into strategic and tactical or opportunistic approaches.

### Strategic Insurer’s Arsenal
The creation of an #oligopsony through consolidation is the main weapon in the strategic arsenal of insurance companies. An **oligopsony** exists when providers (in this case, physicians) significantly outnumber buyers (insurance companies), enabling the insurance companies to dictate prices because of reduced competition. Take, for example, PacifiCare’s $9.2 billion merger with UnitedHealth Group in 2005, which created a vast network of [[Health Maintenance Organization|HMO]] and [[Preferred Provider Organization|PPO]] plans covering more than three million Californians. 

Today, three plans alone ([UnitedHealthcare](https://www.corp-research.org/unitedhealthgroup), [WellPoint](https://www.corp-research.org/anthem), and [Aetna](https://www.corp-research.org/aetna)) cover 77.7 million insured lives. This oligopsony allows the systematic and continuous cost reduction without extra investment. Some examples of this are the annual cut of allowed rates, payment suspension for specific procedures (such as EKGs for routine physicals), offering “all or none” [[Participation]] alternatives, or the creation of “tiered networks” the profile providers and incentivize patients to see lower-cost providers.

### Tactical Insurer’s Arsenal
Increasing billing process complexity, inventing new reasons for denial through arcane terminology, disparate data formats, and modifications of [[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]]/ICD codes and [[Medical necessity]] rules - these are all examples of tactical methods designed to increase providers’ costs for both billing and follow-up and to reduce the payments at the expense of practice owners. 

These methods need continuous investment in personnel training, better process management, and improved technology to keep them effective as providers begin building more sophisticated systems to scrub and analyze claims and to discover payment discrepancies and irregularities.

### Provider Response
Returning to the three incidents mentioned earlier, California’s joint Department of Managed Health Care and Insurance Department determined that these are not isolated cases. They analyzed 1.1 million paid claims from 2005 to 2007 that covered about 190,000 members of PacifiCare’s HMO and PPO plans, and they discovered that 30% of the HMO claims were wrongly denied and 29% of the disputes with doctors were handled incorrectly. 

PacifiCare paid out over $1 million and was fined an additional $3.5 million. A year earlier, the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (NJDOBI) fined Aetna almost $9.5 million for paying certain out-of-network providers -- limited to hospital, emergency, and approved out-of-network consultants -- at 125% of [[Medicare]] rather than the providers’ billed charges, in reparation, for certain services rendered out of network.

In a separate incident, NY Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo said that “he was investigating whether the nation’s health insurance companies had systematically forced patients to pay more than they should when using doctors or hospitals outside of their insurer’s networks.” He also stated that he believed “there was an industry-wide scheme perpetuated by some of the nation’s largest health insurers to deceive and defraud consumers” and that the scheme had lasted “over a decade, potentially adding hundreds of millions of dollars to the out-of-pocket medical expenses of the nation’s consumers.” Linda Lacewell, head of Cuomo’s Healthcare Industry Taskforce, said “To date, we have found that health insurers consistently underpay consumers for their out-of-network medical expenses, and they do it through deception, manipulation of data and outright [[Fraud]].”

The issue at stake is how health insurers determine a Usual, Customary, and Reasonable (UCR) payment for an out-of-network doctor’s services. According to Cuomo, a six-month investigation found that [Ingenix](https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Ingenix) (now **OptumInsight**) operated a defective and manipulated database that most major health insurers used to set reimbursement rates for out-of-network medical expenses. The [probe](https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/3498904d-6994-4e7d-a353-159261240d54) also found that two UnitedHealth units dramatically under-reimbursed members for out-of-network medical expenses by using Ingenix data. In a typical system, when a patient member goes out-of-network, insurers pay 80% of the usual, customary, and reasonable charges, and the patient pays the remaining 20%. 

In the Ingenix case, however, if the UCR was lower than what the doctor charged, then the patient ended up paying 20% of the UCR sum, plus the balance billed by the doctor. For example, if the fair market rate in the New York metropolitan area was $200 for a 15 minute doctor visit for a common illness, but the Ingenix rate was only $77, then UnitedHealth’s 80% payment would be only $62 (80% of $77). The patient would end up paying $138 ($200 - $62) instead of just $40 (20% of $200). 

Lacewell said the Ingenix data was “rigged” in various ways. For example, Ingenix didn’t [[Audit]] the data it received from other insurers, who deleted some higher doctor charges before submitting the data. According to Lacewell, Ingenix itself deleted more high charges -- valid ones -- than low charges. “This is a picture of conflict of interest from top to bottom,” Lacewell said at a press conference, with a chart showing the interrelationship of Ingenix, UnitedHealth, and other insurers. “Every single player on this chart has an interest in keeping rates low. Nobody on this chart has an interest in keeping rates at a fair rate for consumers.” 

In summary, providers need new and effective approaches to mobilize both legal and organizational talent to reverse their revenue decline. Legal methods battle market conditions like oligopsony, while large-scale medical billing networks aggregate claim volumes and create resulting economies of scale to enable analytical discovery of underpayments.

 #### *Whose System Are You Following?*

Healthcare insurance businesses continue to boom, mostly at the expense of both providers and patients. Two key aspects dominate the business background for insurers:

1.  *Insurers must meet tougher profit margin benchmarks*
2.  *Insurers approach the limit of their ability to grow premiums*
    
The motive in business is always profit, but insurance companies have it particularly rough. They play in a massively regulated, traditionally altruistic industry where they are the only for-profit game in town. Against all odds, they aggressively pushed their way to the top. But now, as Wall Street sweethearts, they have stepped through the looking glass into a world that seems to keep pace, no matter how fast they run. The faster they grow profits, the higher they drive expectations, leaving them increasingly desperate for new ideas to generate revenue. Practice owners and billing service managers must assume some responsibility for the current sad state of provider-payer relations. The efficacy of your system determines whether you lead or follow in the provider-payer tango. Payers develop their current system in response to their business needs. Fair or unfair, the onus is on the provider and/or billing service, not the insurer. Rather than complain, you have to learn to thrive within the insurer’s constraints. If the insurer’s system can derail your billing efforts, then you need to adopt a modern billing system that is committed to innovation. It’s that simple.
  
#### The Payer’s System

Payers have developed a simple but effective system to seize control of, and rapidly derail, a significant portion of billing errors. Large-scale financial and technological infrastructure resources available to payers enable them to consolidate. These lend them a unique price-control advantage (oligopsony), along with multiple added sources of revenue, such as underpayments, refunds, and penalties. Payers typically employ the following strategies:

1.  *Increase billing service costs with added complexity and new reasons for denial*
2.  *Reduce allowed fees*
3.  *Increase leverage over providers through consolidation*
4.  *Underpay claims*
5.  *Return for post-payment audits, demand refunds, and impose penalties*

##### 1: Increase Billing Service Costs with Added Complexity and New Reasons for Denial
Payers use obscure and confusing terminology and disparate data formats. Deciphering Payer messages requires sophisticated technology, skilled personnel, and time. Payers also report only one error at a time. So, once you correct that error and resubmit the claim, payers get another chance for a new delay, based on a “newly discovered” error. Next, payers frequently modify both formats and regulatory compliance rules (Correct Coding Initiative or [[National Correct Coding Initiative|CCI]], and local medical review policy, or LMRP). Discovering changes and implementing them in your system requires both investment and time. This allows payers to confront providers with a lose-lose dilemma of expensive process maintenance on the one hand and forfeited payments on the other. 

Payers’ profits can also be directly proportional to payment delays: the longer the delay, the higher the profit. A quick review of basic insurance financial performance metrics helps us understand the delay dynamic. An insurance company offers clients a premium based on  the expected cost of caring for them, plus a markup for administrative costs and profit. Accordingly, most analysts use three metrics to measure financial performance of an insurance company:

1.  **Administrative Cost Ratio (ACR)**: The ratio of administrative and sales expenses to the total income from premiums.
    
2.  **Medical Loss Ratio (MLR)**: The ratio of medical expenses to income from premiums.
    
3.  **Investment Ratio (IR)**: Net investment income divided by revenue from premiums and fees.
 
For example, in 2007 Aetna showed the following performance:

| Premiums and Fees        | $25.5 billion |
| ------------------------ | ------------- |
| MLR                      | 72%           |
| ACR                      | 21%           |
| Combined Ratio           | 93%           |
| Implied Operating Margin | 7%            |


Note that other factors, especially legal fees, also influence profitability. But an insurer can actually turn a profit even if the cost of administration and insurance claims exceeds the premiums it collects. It does so by investing income ***on the float*** in stocks and bonds; the “float” is the time between when a client pays a premium and when the client needs payment for medical expenses. When we add MLR and ACR in the above example, we see that without any investment, Aetna would earn a 7% profit on its premiums alone. Nonetheless, Aetna takes advantage of the float and earns about 7% net interest income on the premiums - bringing its total profit margin to around 14% (ignoring taxes and other revenue sources):

| Premium             | 7%  |
| ------------------- | --- |
| Interest on Premium | 7%  |
| Total               | 14% |
  
Insurance companies have often accused doctors of submitting incomplete and inaccurate claims, and they’ve justified the delays with the time needed to discover fraudulent claims. But some states have found insurance companies guilty of, and have penalized them for, intentionally delaying payments to profit from the float.

#### 2: Reduce Allowed Fees

Average physician reimbursement from billing Medicare and commercial payers dropped 17% from 2002 to 2006. From 2005 to 2006, allowed amounts for E/M visits alone dropped 10% nationally, 27% in the Northeast, and 20% in the Northwest.

#### 3: Increase Leverage Over Provide through Consolidation

It’s harder to drop a contract with low allowed amounts when there are fewer remaining payers. Consolidation in the insurance industry reduces competition among payers for physicians’ services (hence, oligopsony), allowing payers to pay less to providers. Today, 73% of the insured population are covered by just three plans; the top 10 health plans cover 106 million lives. In 2006, the consolidation rate accelerated. For instance, UnitedHealthcare Group purchased 11 plans, including MetLife, PacifiCare, and Oxford. Turning down a contract offered by a payer that controls such a large portion of the population results in giving up significant revenue from medical billing. To drive providers into networks with lower allowed amounts, payers invented the “Enrollee Payment Program.” For instance, UnitedHealthcare announced a new national policy to discontinue direct payment of medical billing to out-of-network providers. Under the Pay the Enrollee program, UHC directs out-of-network benefit checks to the insured member rather than the non-participating providers. As hard as it is to collect from the insurer, surely having to chase the actual patient for payment is harder and more costly, and it results in even lower collections. This policy forces the providers to choose between chasing the patients for payment or joining the payer’s network. In both cases, the provider loses some earned revenue. 

Oxford Health Plans, a UHC company, implemented the Pay the Enrollee policy and, according to the Oxford website announcement, Oxford may refuse to honor the Assignment of Benefits for claims from non-participating providers pursuant to language in the Certificate of Coverage. If enrollees choose to receive out-of-network treatment, the claim reimbursement may be sent directly to the enrollee. In such cases, the non-participating provider is instructed to bill the covered enrollee for services rendered. Additionally, if patients continue to use out-of-network labs, physicians could face sanctions, including a “change of eligibility” in UHC’s pay-for-performance and quality-rating programs, a “decreased [[Fee schedule]],” or termination from the plan’s network. Once the provider is in network, the payers implement profiling techniques to identify inefficient physicians. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) study examined 10 healthcare purchasers with profiling systems to determine whether inefficient physicians could be identified.

After identifying inefficient physicians, the payers provided incentives to improve efficiency, such as the following:

-   Educating physicians to encourage more efficient care
    
-   Designating in physician directories those physicians who have met efficiency and quality standards
    
-   Dividing physicians into tiers based on efficiency, and giving enrollees financial incentives to see physicians in their particular tiers
    
-   Providing physician bonuses, or imposing penalties, based on efficiency and quality standards.
    
-   Excluding inefficient physicians from the network
    
#### 4: Underpay Claims

Partial denials cause the average medical practice to lose as much as 11% of its revenue. Denial management is difficult because of the complexity of denial causes, payer variety, and claim volume. Denial risk varies with different classes of claims, depending on claim complexity, temporary constraints, and payer idiosyncrasies. For complex claims, most payers pay the full amount for one item, but only part of the remaining items, which creates opportunities for underpayment. Temporary constraints often cause payment errors because constraints are misapplied. Payer idiosyncrasies may arise when payers have different interpretations of CCI bundling rules or the coverage of certain services.

#### 5: Return for Post-Payment Audits, Demand Refunds, and Impose Penalties

The top two revenue-boosting wells for payers are drying up. Premium wars preclude insurers from raising rates, and recently enacted timely payment laws limit how long they can withhold repayment to earn interest as they had in the past. To meet profit expectations and still play within the new rules, insurers have decided to pursue the reimbursements after they are paid. The Justice Department recovered a record $3.1 billion in fraud and false claims in 2006. It’s an undeniably unscrupulous game. And if you’re a billing provider, you should know about it because unless you’re actively working to manage audit exposure, your clients are at risk.

If your skepticism has led you to the “rational” rebuttal that audits are expensive for everyone, rest assured that the invisible hand (gloved in technology) has helped insurers overcome this traditional obstacle. Driven by the simple goal of reducing the cost of identifying audit targets, insurers began building databases. With the advent of electronic submission, this became almost costless. As with many purportedly win-win propositions we’ve seen from insurers, electronic submission has proven to be a wolf in sheep’s clothing. As providers submit claims to be paid, insurers simply add each claim to their growing database, and their computer science geeks regularly crank out reports that give executives a bird’s eye view of all of their providers.

Invariably, providers are in denial about their exposure, and insurers are quick to comfort them. They’ll tell you that audits are an unfortunate but necessary tactic for keeping fraud in check, implying that honest providers have nothing to worry about. But insurers are not crusaders for truth and justice. Providers need to understand that **the payer’s motive is money, the payer’s means is a gargantuan statistical database, and every provider is an opportunity**. Healthcare finance insiders call this a Big Brother system, and, setting aside the melodramatic implications of such a name, it’s easy to see why. Table 2 presents a short list of the types of reports generated by insurance companies.

#### Audit Triggers: Profiling Methodology

| STAGE              | REPORT                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Pre-Payment Review | CCI and LMRP Rules              |
|                    | Inter-, Intra-, and Cross-claim |
|                    | Lifetime Duplicates             |
|                    | Date Range Duplicates           |
|                    | Re-bundling                     |
|                    | Modifier Codes                  |
|                    | E/M Crosswalk                   |
|                    | Visit Level                     |
| Post-Payment Audit | Procedure Repetition            |
|                    | High Payments Per Day           |
|                    | Surge Analysis                  |
|                    | Unusual [[Modifiers]]               |
|                    | Unusual Procedure Rates         |
|                    | Geographic Improbabilities      |
|                    | 5/50 Patterns                   |
| External Resources | Provider Watch Lists            |
|                    | OIG Sanctions Databases         |
|                    | High-Risk Address Databases     |

While executives have a soft spot for pretty charts, the true power of such a system is its ability to drill into the data and find outliers. (When they talk about this type of tool, information systems specialists use jargon like data mining and online analytical processing, or OLAP.) The system automatically pinpoints providers who are “easy audit targets” for one of the following reasons:  
  

-   They’re doing something that’s different from the pack
    
-   They lack the infrastructure for systematic denial follow-up
    
-   They lack compliant medical notes
    

  

### ***Traditional Billing Systems***

Traditional billing systems limit the provider’s role in the provider-payer tango, and they transfer the payment and decision initiative to the payer. Except for the initial claim submission, providers are completely passive at every step. You wait for the payer to review the claim, wait to receive the errors, wait for the review of the corrected submission, and wait, and wait. By waiting for the payer to determine if, when, and how much of the claim will be paid, you waste valuable time and further reduce the chances of getting the claim paid.

The average claim error rate without professional assistance is about 45 - 55%. If your only method of finding errors is to submit the claim to the payer and wait for the payer’s response, you’ll need multiple submission cycles for each claim until you eradicate every error. By delaying your own response to a billing operator’s query for claim clarification, you again waste valuable time and further reduce the chances of getting the claim paid.

If your billing operator delays follow up or selectively follows up on big-balance claims only, you may be doing the following: 

-   **Encouraging** the payer to keep accumulating a significant portion of your revenue.
    
-   **Increasing your audit risk** as you signal the payer that you might not have an adequate infrastructure to properly document every patient visit, just as you’re unable to discover underpayments.
 
If you don’t manage the individual productivity of billing personnel, you create three kinds of opportunities for the payers to keep your money:

-   You deprive your billing personnel the chance to improve their skills and productivity.
    
-   Without “Grand Error” perspective, you prevent your entire billing infrastructure from improving its performance and you’re unable to keep up with the payers that frequently change formats and billing compliance requirements.
    
-   You encourage the billing office to simply collect fees only on uncontested and easily paid claims, forfeiting payments of problematic claims without even making any effort to collect.
 
A recent American Medical Association (AMA) study found that doctors spend 14% of the fees they receive from insurance companies on the process of collecting those fees, adding more than $200 billion a year to the nation’s healthcare costs. Sadly, about 30% of over five billion claims generated annually are rejected - and surprisingly, only 50% of the rejected claims are ever re-submitted.

Note that physicians are giving up this revenue in addition to losing revenue because of the annual cuts of allowed fees. Insurance companies would like us to think that billing costs are high because of inefficiencies, and they’re quick to blame the doctors. 

According to UHC spokesman Gregory Thompson, “data show there is often a significant lag time between when services are provided and physician claims are submitted.” Another oft-cited reason for delays and underpayments is the time that doctors take to resubmit claims or provide additional information upon the insurer’s request.

But a recent AMA “report card” shows a wide variance between various payers in terms of payment accuracy and timeliness, ranging from 61% to 87% of the time. Such a wide variance contradicts the “physician’s inefficiency” theory. If this theory were true, then the more-efficient physicians would lose less money on rejections than others, and this would be uniform across all payers. 

Conversely, since the largest insurance companies are present in most states and are exposed to the vast majority of physicians and their claim delays, the differences in underpayments and denials must be attributed, first of all, to the differences in payers’ business strategies and processes - and not to inefficiencies in the provider’s office. 

For instance, a simple calculation shows that systematic claim denial is beneficial to payers when the cost of rework outweighs the benefit of re-submitting the claim. Let’s assume the following:

| $130 | Initial Charge            |
| ---- | ------------------------- |
| $55  | Allowed Amount            |
| $29  | Service Cost              |
| $6   | Initial Claim Preparation |
| $25  | Claim Rework Cost         |
 
If the claim is paid in full after the contractual adjustment from $130 to $55, the profit would be as follows:

| $55 | Allowed Amount                          |
| --- | --------------------------------------- |
| $35 | Total Initial Practice Costs ($29 + $6) |
| $20 | Practice Income                         | 

But if the payer denies part of the claim - say $30 - then the provider has to choose between the options in Table 3.

In other words, depending on the claim rework costs, denial amount, and repeat denial odds or claim rework efficacy, it may be in the provider’s best interest to minimize losses by abandoning the denied claim instead of working the denial. Therefore, rational payers will deny a higher number of claims; they count on the good business sense of rational providers who will rework only a small subset of the denied claims, specifically those claims that they can justify with a quick cost-benefit calculation, such as the aforementioned example. Rational payers’ behavior like this explains the AMA findings much better than any inefficiency on the provider’s side.

To justify rework of every denial and to eliminate a financial incentive for payers to deny claims, providers need systems with low claim rework costs and high rework efficacy. To “educate and empower physicians so they are no longer at the mercy of a chaotic payment system that takes countless hours away from patient care” requires a leveled playing field for both providers and payers. And leveling the playing field with the payers requires equal footing in terms of strategies, processes, and resources. Otherwise, if you follow a traditional billing system (i.e., a passive system), you’ll fall into the payer’s system and wind up doing what the payer expects - leaving a significant portion of your money with the payer.
