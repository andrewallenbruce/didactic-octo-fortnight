# DAR Definition (Mine)
Days in accounts receivable (also known as DAR or Days in A/R) is a common financial metric belonging to a group of ratios called efficiency ratios. 

[Measuring Company Efficiency To Maximize Profits](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/measuring-company-efficiency/)

What Is Efficiency?
The term efficiency refers to the peak level of performance that uses the least amount of inputs to achieve the highest amount of output. Efficiency requires reducing the number of unnecessary resources used to produce a given output, including personal time and energy. It is a measurable concept that can be determined using the ratio of useful output to total input. It minimizes the waste of resources such as physical materials, energy, and time while accomplishing the desired output.


Understanding Efficiency
The term efficiency can be defined as the ability to achieve an end goal with little to no waste, effort, or energy. Being efficient means you can achieve your results by putting the resources you have in the best way possible. Put simply, something is efficient if nothing is wasted and all processes are optimized. This includes the use of money, human capital, production equipment, and energy sources.


Efficiency can be used in a variety of ways to describe various optimization processes. As such, analyzing efficiency can help reduce costs and increase bottom lines. For instance:

It measures the average amount of time it takes for a business to collect money owed from the responsible party for services rendered and billed.

As its name implies, the unit of measurement employed by this particular metric is days, or rather the average number of days from the moment that a physician provides a service until the patient pays for that service. This number can tell you much about the financial health of the business.

For example, if an organization’s Days in A/R is 75, this means that, on average, it’s taking 75 days to collect its outstanding balances. From this, management can expect to need close to three months of working capital to meet the organization’s financial obligations. If Days in A/R continues to rise, this could put it into serious financial trouble.

A low DAR is also undesirable. Though less common, a low number of days in A/R is cause for as much concern as a high number.

MEDICAL ACCOUNT PERFORMANCE
It is understood that your monthly accounts receivable should never be more than 1.5x your monthly charges. When you conduct your practice analysis, you may ask why the practice is not collecting more accounts receivable. There are multiple ways to measure your performance. Using these, you may find the issue.

One of the most common ways to measure your medical accounts receivable performance is to measure the number of days it takes to collect the payments. You can calculate the number of AR days by dividing the number of charges over the number of days.

# Days in AR (AAPC)
Good measure for how efficient a business is in managing A/R. A lower number represents a more efficient A/R process. A very useful measurement if [[Adjustments]] and [[Write-Off|write-offs]] are being applied and managed correctly. 

The success of a practice’s billing operations is often measured in A/R days. ==The A/R balance can be reduced by receiving payments or by entering contractual or [[Write-Off|write off]] adjustments==. It is important to manage the A/R balance as claims become much more difficult to collect the older they become. Good management of the A/R is also imperative to maintaining a good cash flow for the business. A poor A/R process can result in loss of money to the business and result in financial strains to the owners. If all these tasks are being done properly, the days in A/R number should be low, in contrast, high days in A/R number will most likely tell you there is a problem in your revenue cycle.

# Days in AR (Lirov)
A growing number of days in [[accounts receivable]] is symptomatic of a faulty billing process. One way to determine DAR is to ==count the days from the date of service to the date of payment for every claim, and then average that across all [[Claim Form|claims]]==. A simpler way to compute average number of days in AR is by taking a ratio of accounts receivable to average daily charges, or

## [[Formula]] 1
**Number of Days in Accounts Receivable** = 
( Accounts Receivable / Average Daily Charge) x 365

This [[metric]] also depends on the medical specialty, patient demographics, [[Payer Mix | payer mix]], and [[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]] sample. 

Another ==downside== is that this metric is sensitive to the provider because it counts the lag time of unsubmitted claims for services already delivered. This lag time roughly averages across all payers, making DAR an ==effective comparison metric between payers for an individual provider, but invalidating it across multiple providers.==

One obvious ==advantage== of the DAR metric is its ==independence of charges.== The average feature of this metric eliminates sensitivity to a specific day or [[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]], but it also hides the behavior shape of the [[accounts receivable]] curve.

# Days Outstanding in AR Ratio (Reiboldt)
Monitoring and measuring [[Accounts Receivable|AR]] in a medical practice is one of the most important indicators an entity’s leadership can use in maximizing value in the business. Analyzing days outstanding in AR essentially determines the average amount of ==discounted== charges billed over a defined period (e.g. 30, 60, or 90 days).

>*==Average AR should not exceed an amount that encompasses a practice’s average monthly discounted charges.==*

## Formula 2
**Days outstanding in AR is derived with the following formula:**
- **==Adjusted Charges for the Last *n* Months==** divided by the
	
- **==Total Number of Days for *n* Months==** = the
	
- **==Average Adjusted Revenue per Day==**

## Formula 3
**Alternatively, to determine total days outstanding in AR a practice can:**
1. Divide the **==Total Outstanding Adjusted A/R==** by the
	
2. **==Average Adjusted AR==** then divide that by the
	
3. **==Average Adjusted Revenue Per Day==**

As an example, if a practice’s total charges for the last 90 days were $380,000 and the total outstanding balance was $400,000, average adjusted revenue would be calculated with the following formula:

>$380,000 / 90 days = $4,222
$400,000 / $4,222 = 94.74 days in AR

In this example, this ratio means that it takes the practice 95 days on average to collect it’s outstanding balances. This in turn tells management that at least three months of working capital is required to maintain the practice’s cash flow needs. Worded differently, if the practice is going to meet its financial obligations, it will need to have three months of cash reserves on hand for working capital purposes, or it will have to borrow these amounts, which will in turn have additional repercussions on the entity’s balance sheet.

In terms of medical practices, ratios pertaining to an organization’s outstanding AR figures (eg, days in AR) are a useful tool in measuring net working capital and ultimately assessing the profitability of the practice. However, it would not be appropriate to compare, for example, a cardiology group’s days of outstanding AR with that of a plastic surgery practice, because the most common methods of reimbursement are dramatically different between those two types of entities. This would not be an appropriate “apples-to-apples” comparison, and such accuracy in benchmarking criteria is the mortar that allows the bricks of analysis to firmly fit together and hold up to pressure.

## Collection Ratio (Ch. 5)
One of the most telling measurements indicating the efficiency of a medical practice’s financial management is the collection ratio. Although variations of this ration are used in a variety of businesses, its determinants are unique in healthcare service entities because of the fundamental economics of their business model. 

The collection ratio, also sometimes referred to as the “gross collections ratio,” is derived by dividing a practice’s [[Fee schedule|gross charges]] (i.e. total amount of services billed) by its net collections (i.e., the actual amount collected.) The formula is 
- *Gross Charges / Net Collections = Gross Collections Ratio*

The collection ratio measures the impact of a practice’s contractual [[Adjustments]] on its overall earnings. Expressed a different way, a practice’s collection ratio measures what the business brought in versus the value of services for which it ultimately billed.

In traditional business models, the collection ratio is derived by dividing a company’s total AR by its annualized revenue figure:
- *(AR / (Revenue / 365)) = Collection Ratio*

This essentially illustrates how quickly the company collects payments for services and/or products delivered to a customer. The higher the collection ratio, the more difficulty a company is having in being paid for its services. 

For companies that sell their products/services directly to consumers, this measurement is typically different because they are often paid on an immediate fee-for-service basis (i.e., consumers render at point of service.) For business-to-business companies, this can be more important because fees for services/products rendered in this model are typically invoiced, and most businesses remit payments on a monthly basis. Therefore, it can take 30 or more days for a company to receive payment for its services or products from another business. If that number increases dramatically, this could mean the business is having more difficult time collecting payment from its customers. The reason could range from the basic timing of cash flow fluctuations to liquidity and/or insolvency issues, the latter of which could easily result in the original business never receiving any payment for its services or products. All of this is critical when considering that business’ financial health, in addition to the fact that managers within that business must incorporate these trends into the budgeting and capital planning processes.

The collection ratio for a medical practice, however, goes beyond the basic scenario outlined above, because in addition to the general fluctuations in the business’ cash flows, there is an additional variable that most businesses do not have to consider, and that is the practice’s contractual adjustments.

## Contractual Adjustments
Although medical practices are more consumer-centered business models in nature, the presence of third-party reimbursement and contractual pricing adjustments essentially means that medical practices must operate in a business-to-business revenue model while the services model is business-to-consumer. This can double a practice’s financial stress, in that the timing of billing and collections can create cash flow challenges, in addition to the general difference between actual income derived after contractual adjustments.

Contractual adjustments refers to the values for certain services negotiated between a medical provider (individual or entity) and third party payers. Simply put, although a physician may bill a specific amount (X) for certain services or procedures, which in theory have a certain value attached, the third party payers with which the provider contracts will only actually pay a portion of that amount (X - n).

There is a fundamental economic inefficiency in this model, in that prices for health care services are not set by market forces (i.e., supply and demand) as they typically are in an open-market system. Instead, prices are set by individual contractual arrangements, which are negotiated on an even further individual basis, ultimately resulting in no real demand or pricing curve. The impact of this key inefficiency in the health care economic pricing model is a much larger issue that extends beyond the scope of this discussion; however, this concept is critical in understanding the basic profitability and degree of financial stability for any health care service business where third party payer contracts are involved.

Ultimately, a practice’s collection ratio will typically indicate how well it is collecting for services rendered - or, from the more pessimistic perspective, how significant the gap is between the value of services rendered and the actual amount paid for the same services. [[Collection ratios]] are going to range significantly among different types of practices, based on size, specialty, region, and demographic makeup of the practice’s patient base (i.e., [[payer mix]].) Practices involving specialties where there is substantial reimbursement from [[Medicare]] and certain private insurance payers continue to watch the gap between charges and collections grow, ultimately depressing these businesses’ margins severely. Conversely, some practices have evolved to find new ways to expand profitability and maintain margins, despite reimbursement pressure. While it is unclear how collection ratios will evolve for practices in the long run, one thing that is certain is the need for practices to find new methods of sustaining profitability. Although there is a difference in timing of the charges being collected today versus those placed on the books at a later date, a collection ratio clearly presents a percentage of such performance relative to adjusted charges.

# Receivables Ratios (Finkler p148)
One problem faced by most health care organizations is the timely collection of receivables (i.e., the money owed by insurance companies or patients to the health care organization for services rendered). Once receivables are collected, the money received can be used to pay off loans or be invested. This means that once money is received, either the organization would be paying less interest or it would be earning more interest. Therefore, organizations want to collect receivables promptly.

We often think of receivables in terms of how long it takes from billing to collection. A useful aid in analysis is to convert your patient revenue into a measure that represents the number of days in accounts receivable. Days in accounts receivable is an easy ratio to calculate and understand, once you break it down to its component parts. The numerator - net accounts receivable - is used as a proxy for the amount of money your patients and their insurers owe at any point in time, which you ultimately expect to collect. It is important to note that because this figure comes from the balance sheet, it technically is the value of accounts receivable on a specific day. We are therefore assuming that the last day of the fiscal year is a good representation of accounts receivable on any given day. If this is not a valid assumption, you can also calculate the average accounts receivable balance by taking the beginning of the year value plus the ending receivables value and dividing by two. This yields the “average” accounts receivable. Alternatively, you can find the average value of receivables at the end of each of the 12 months of the year.

The denominator in the DAR ratio is simply the annual patient revenue divided by the average revenue per day. Average receivables divided by the average revenue yields the number of days the average bill stays a receivable. For LCH, the DAR equals 77 (52,000,000 / (247,000,000 / 356)).

In other words, it is taking LCH 77 days to convert a bill into a cash collection. At first thought, you would think that you would want this ratio as low as possible. However, much like the current ratio, you want the DAR ratio neither too high nor too low. You really are striving for a middle ground, rather than far to one extreme. This is because, if you try to keep the days in AR extremely low, your credit manager may attempt to deny credit to anyone that typically pays slowly, which is not necessarily in the best interest of the organization. The services that the credit manager is denying may create enough revenue that the organization benefits even if the customer or insurer is slow to pay.

You, therefore, want to not only calculate the days in AR, but you also need to investigate that ratio to see if a short average days in AR indicates too restrictive of a credit policy or if a long days in AR indicates too loose a credit policy or a lack of sufficient efforts to collect in a timely manner.

One final caution with respect to days in AR: many health care organizations are dominated by one or two payers, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Long term care facilities, for example, may have as much as 90% of their revenue come from a state Medicaid program. Programs like Medicaid have been known to skip payments to providers if the annual budget for their state is not passed on a timely basis. The providers typically have no recourse, and the state ultimately catches up. At the time of the skipped payment, however, the days in AR rises dramatically (i.e., the organization is carrying twice the normal receivables). Once again, this points to the fact that all ratios need to be taken with a grain of salt, and the analyst must look at the context within which the specific numerical value exists. It also shows the important of ratios, such as days of cash on hand. Can the organization sustain a period without cash collections?

## Formula 4
Days in Accounts Receivable =
Net Accounts Receivable divided by
(Net Patient Revenue) / 365

## Deferred Revenues
AR (and, therefore DAR as well) may be artificially inflated by the inclusion of items such as deferred revenues. Deferred revenues represent amounts that customers, such as [[Health Maintenance Organization|health maintenance organizations]], have prepaid for care. Until the organization provides patient care, it shows the amount as a liability.  Once it provides care, it eliminates the liability from the balance sheet and records revenue. Because the organization never really intends to repay these advances (it intends to provide care), it is not as critical if these amounts remain on the balance sheet for a number of days.

# Days in AR (Moore p55 vol1)
PM systems differ in the way claims are aged (how long a payer has been responsible for a claim). For example, some PM systems re-age the claim (reset the aging days to zero) as the claim moves from [[Primary vs. Secondary Insurance|primary]] insurance to secondary to tertiary and again when the patient becomes responsible. Other [[Practice Management System|PMs]] do not recalculate aging as the responsible party changes. Some practices may want to follow their PM system’s logic so that the customized reports tie to the canned PM reports. For other practices, custom analysis in a reporting [[database]] is an opportunity to look at aging in ways that the PM system may not provide. Depending on the lag days (the time between the last date of service on a claim and the date the claim is submitted), some practices may want to age claims from the last date of service on a claim, while other practices may want to age claims from the date the claim is first billed. The reporting [[database]] can also include multiple ways to age a claim, if that detail is helpful to a practice.

## Forecast Collections Based on AR Balance
AR does not pay the practice’s bills. Cash pays the bills. This report can be used to estimate the amount of cash the practice will receive from the current AR balance. The AR balance in the Aging [[Pivot Table]] example is $1,520,420. Physicians, owners, and practice managers may want to know how much the practice can expect to receive from this AR and when it can expect to receive it. Depending on the PM system, the first trick may be to segregate AR by whether the balance is due from primary, secondary, or tertiary insurance, or whether the balance is due from the patient. Once the accounts are segregated, understanding the practice’s billed charges philosophy, billing office workflow, and historical [[data]] can help forecast cash.

For example, assume the practice’s billed charges are, on average, three times the amount of the practice’s contracts. Assume also that the billing office records an adjustment to reflect the contractual allowance when the primary insurance’s remittance is processed. In this example, the practice will receive approximately one-third of the AR balances shown as due from primary insurance. This is an approximate number because paid copayments and deductibles will reduce the amount due from the primary insurance, while any amounts the primary insurance allows but does not pay may not be 100 percent collectible from secondary insurances and patients.

Once the remittance is processed and contractual adjustments have been made, the balance due from secondary insurances and patients should be 100 percent collectible. In reality, some of those patient balances may not be collected. A historical analysis of bad debt expense compared to patient collections will help quantify how much of the patient balances will be collected. In the example below, 97.5% of balances from secondaries and tertiaries are expected to be collected (since some may end up being the patient’s responsibility), but only 70% of patient balances are expected to be collected (all the more reason to collect as much as possible at the time of service). Using those figures, the total cash estimated to be received is $748,777.

| **Aging**       | **$ Sum of Balance** | **% Estimated** | **$ Estimated** |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Primary     | $868,897          | 32.0%       | $278,047     |
| Secondary   | $38,970           | 97.5%       | $37,996      |
| Tertiary    | $14,351           | 97.5%       | $13,992      |
| Patient     | $598,208          | 70.0%       | $418,742     |
| GRAND TOTAL | $1,520,420        | - - -       | $748,777    |

A [[data analysis]] comparing claim date to payment date can also estimate when the amounts will be collected. For example, historical trend may reveal that insurance balances are collected on average within 24 days. Of the 70% of patient balances that are collected, half may be collected in 30 days and the other half in the next 30 days. This formula can then be used to estimate when the AR will be collected.

## Formula 5
This report appears simple to create, but obtaining the data can be tricky. MGMA-ACMPE calculates days in AR as the total AR, divided by total gross fee for service charges, divided by 365. The trick is trending the DAR calculation. If it is difficult to get historical AR data from your system, calculate DAR and store the data in SQL server or Excel. Once you have historical data to [[chart]], you can look at trends in DAR and reasons for the change. The example below shows that the Urology Department’s DAR is higher than average. The sparkline shows that DAR is increasing. This data could also be displayed by financial class or payer.


![](https://i.imgur.com/FUGXnJx.jpg)

## Days to Resolve Claims
The DAR report may not paint a full picture, because a few high-dollar claims might skew the calculations. When providers are added to the practice or a dramatic change in the fee schedule occurs, the DAR can be significantly off for a long period of time. Another way to look at AR data is to analyze how long it takes to get each claim paid in full. Take a year’s worth of claims and chart how many days it takes to get the claims paid. Using this data, you can look for the types of claims that are delaying the collections and work with payers, physicians, coders, and billing staff to shorten the time frames.

As with many AR measures, be careful not to incentivize the wrong thing. The goal is to collect the balance due as quickly as possible, not to get the claim balance to zero as quickly as possible. Monitor bad debt and collections adjustments to make sure that those balances are not increasing to make other measures look better.

## Percentage of Resolved Claims
You can also look at claims data by evaluating the percentage of claims resolved to a zero balance by month. This report segregates AR by a practice’s locations and then shows the percentage of claims billed each month that now have a zero balance, the dollar amount of outstanding claims, and the number of outstanding claims. This same report could also be organized by payers or specialty.

## Patient Accounts Receivable
This report is another way to look at detailed AR balances. 

## Adjusted Fee-For-Service Collection Percentage
An adjusted FFS collection percentage is the difference between what the practice actually collected and the amount available to be collected. The key is to properly divide adjustments between contractual adjustments that are required to be taken and other adjustments such as bad debt and collections balances. According to MGMA-ACMPE’s David Gans, one way to think about contractual adjustments is that they are knowable prior to claim submission. Contractual allowances, multiple surgery discounts, and payer-specific coding rules are examples of contractual adjustments. The objective is to determine the amount of the claim that is potentially collectible.

# Accounts Receivable
[[Accounts Receivable]]
Money owed to the practice for services rendered and billed.

A/R is the total charges entered that have not been collected. It identifies charges that have been submitted to an insurance payer or patient but have not been paid. The A/R balance can be reduced by receiving payments or by entering contractual or [[write-off]] [[Adjustments]]. Claims become more difficult and costlier to collect the older they become.

Accounts receivable (A/R) represents money owed to the healthcare practice by patients and/or insurance carriers. The accounts receivable cycle begins with the delivery of service and continues until payment for the service is reconciled to a zero balance.

Accounts receivable management is a system that assists providers in the collection of the reimbursement for services rendered. The functions of [[accounts receivable]] management include insurance verification, insurance eligibility, [[prior authorization]], billing and claims submission, posting payments, and collections.

The accounts receivable department manages the amounts owed to a facility by patients who received services but whose payments will be made at a later date by the patients or guarantors or their third-party payers. After the claim is submitted to a TPP for reimbursement, the time allowed to remit a payment to accounts receivable begins. Typical performance statistics maintained by the accounts receivable department include days in AR and aging of accounts. Days in AR is calculated by dividing the ending AR balance for a given period by the average revenue per day. Facilities typically set performance goals for this standard.

Monitoring and measuring AR in a medical practice is one of the most important indicators an entity’s leadership can use in maximizing value in the business. Analyzing days outstanding in AR essentially determines the average amount of discounted charges billed over a defined period (e.g. 30, 60, or 90 days). Average AR should not exceed an amount that encompasses a practice’s average monthly discounted charges.

## Formula 6
Days in A/R is a fraction. The numerator is the total A/R. The denominator is average daily charges. Average daily charges are calculated by taking the total charges over the last 2 months (can also be one month) and dividing by the total number of days in those two (or one) months.

Example:
Total A/R = $200,000
Average Daily Charge = $4,250
Days in A/R = \$200,000/$4,250 = 47.06 days in A/R

# Aging of Accounts
Aging of accounts is maintained in 30-day increments (0 - 30, 31 - 60, and so forth.) Facilities monitor the number of accounts and the total dollar value in each increment. The older the account or the longer the account remains unpaid, the less likely the facility will receive reimbursement for the encounter.

Most claims are originally billed to insurance, and until the insurance makes a payment, the responsibility for the payment continues to be with the insurance carrier. After the insurance carrier makes or denies a payment (and there is no just cause for an appeal), the responsibility for the balance of the account will switch to either the physician (to be written off) or to the patient (to be sent an invoice.)

Aging categorizes A/R according to the length of time charges have been outstanding as well as the responsible parties. These time periods are commonly 0 - 30 days, 31 - 60 days, 61 - 90 days, 91 - 120 days, and 121+ days. Aging is usually represented as a dollar amount and a percentage. 

Aging can be broken down by many metrics, such as provider, patient, insurance types (commercial, primary, secondary, worker’s comp, [[Managed Care Organization|managed care]]), facility, diagnosis and procedural code, specialty, etc.

# Claims Reconciliation and Collections
The last component of the revenue cycle is claims reconciliation and collections. The healthcare facility uses the EOB, MSN, and RA to reconcile accounts. In this process the facility compares expected reimbursement to the actual reimbursement provided by the TPP and patient. EOBs and MSNs identify the amount owed by the patient to the facility. Collections can contact the patient to collect outstanding deductibles and copayments. RAs indicate rejected or denied line items or whole claims. Facilities can review the RAs and determine whether the claim can be corrected and resubmitted for additional payment. If a correction is not warranted, reconciliation can be made via [[write-off]] or adjustment to the patient’s account. After the account has been settled, the revenue cycle is complete.


# Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio
The Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is calculated by dividing a company's Net Credit Sales for the period by its average Net [[Accounts Receivable]] (you compute the average Net Accounts Receivable by adding the ending balance of Net Accounts Receivable to the beginning balance of Net Accounts Receivable and dividing the amount by two).  

The Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio tells you how many times the company collected its receivables during the period.  A higher Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is considered a good thing because it means the company is doing a good job collecting its credit sales.  However, what is a "good" ratio varies by industry, so you should compare a company's Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio to the ratios of the firm's competitors (and also look at the trend in the ratio over time).

If 5, means that on average the organization recovered it’s accounts receivable 5 times that year.

Average Net AR = AR Beginning of the Year + AR End of the Year / 2

# Gross Charges
Gross charges, which can be considered the *full [[fee schedule]]* charges, are typically all charges generated by the practice, regardless of actual reimbursement or before discounting. Although gross charges are a valid method used to determine productivity within a practice from one provider to another, they have little relationship with bottom-line performance. A practice should be careful in using gross charges as a measurement or standard of productivity because they do not reflect the revenue collected by the practice. Gross charges are valid measurements of productivity but do not reflect actual financial performance.

- Unbilled encounters/Denials related to [[credentialing]], taxonomy, NPI (group vs. individual), PTAN, Incident-to, [[locum tenens]], inadequate documentation, etc.
- Misappropriation of funds
- Services rendered but never billed

### Patient Liability
The percentage of patient liability is the ratio of patient responsibility to total billed charges, and it roughly reflects patient deductibles. This metric is important in measuring front office function because it has little to do with [[Clean claim]] submission or effective follow-up. DAR is sensitive to it though, as the amount of patient liability sits in accounts receivable until paid.

### [[PARBX]]
The percentage of accounts receivable beyond X number of days, otherwise known as [[PARBX]], resolves the sensitivity issue of the DAR metric. It offers a simple billing process metric that is not dependent on the charge.

Its graphic representation has a skewed bell shape with its steepness representing billing process quality.

- a steep curve and thin tail mean a healthy billing process
- a flat bell and fat tail mean billing problems

According to the MGMA survey, 25%-35% of the average family practice’s accounts receivables were more than 120 days old in 1997. This number has improved down to 17.7% in 2004.

### [[BPI]]
[[PARBX]] can then be used to calculate a [[BPI]], or [[BPI|Billing Performance Index]]. BPI is a key billing performance characteristic because it’s an indicator of claims that are never paid. Obviously, the lower the index, the better the billing performance. But this statistic is meaningful only when considered in the context of the relative performance of other payers.

### [[Payer Mix]] Ratio
[[Payer Mix]] is the percentage of revenue coming from each type of contracted payer such as government-based insurance, commercial insurance, and self-paying individuals for a facility or provider. Obtaining a detailed understanding of a practice’s [[payer mix]] is essential to achieving a comprehensive analysis of the entity’s broader financial stability, as well as being critical to ongoing financial management on behalf of the practice’s leadership.
