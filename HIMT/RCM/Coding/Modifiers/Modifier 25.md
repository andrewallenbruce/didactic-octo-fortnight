# Modifier 25
*Significant, separately identifiable evaluation and management service by the same physician or other qualified healthcare professional on the same day of the procedure or other service*

## Description
This modifier is appended to minor procedures with either 000 or 010 global days, or procedures not covered by global surgery rules (XXX global indicator). A separate E/M should not be billed automatically with a minor procedure or an XXX procedure. The pre-procedure, intra-procedure, and post-procedure work are included. The [[Medicare]] Global Surgery rules also prohibit the reporting of an E/M service for the work associated with the decision to perform a minor procedure whether the patient is new or established.

## NCCI Example
A patient sees his family provider for follow up of his hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. He also has a skin lesion he wants the provider to look at. The provider performs a detailed history, and detailed exam, and moderate medical decision making (99214) for the hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. In addition, the provider looks at the lesion on his arm. The skin lesion is slightly irritated and erythematous. The provider determines it is a benign neoplasm and removes it with an excised diameter of 1.8 cm (11402).

The CCM modifier 1 indicates the two codes can be reported together if a modifier applies. In this case, both an evaluation and management service (99214) and the procedure (11402) were significant, separately identifiable services. The codes that should be assigned are 11402, 99214-25. Modifier 25 may only be appended to E/M codes, not procedure codes. Modifier 25 indicates the evaluation and management service was separately identifiable from the work performed for the procedure. Otherwise, the E/M code is typically denied as inclusive to the procedure. When appending modifier 25, documentation must support two separately identifiable services.

In the above situation, the diagnosis code used for the procedure and the diagnosis used for the E/M code will be different. This will support [[Medical necessity]] and the use of modifier 25. The use of a different diagnosis code is not required for modifier 25 but does apply in this situation. Ensure that the correct diagnosis code is attached to the correct CPT® code. For this example, report the following:

| CPT      | ICD-10-CM         |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| 99214-25 | I10, E78.5, F32.9 |
| 11402    | D23.60            |

```ad-billing
title: Billing
The NCCI edits state, “In general E&M services on the same date of service as the minor surgical procedure are included in the payment for the procedure. The decision to perform a minor surgical procedure is included in the payment for the minor surgical procedure and should not be reported separately as an E&M service.” This statement supports the necessity for the evaluation and management service to be separate from the surgical procedure to be reported separately.
