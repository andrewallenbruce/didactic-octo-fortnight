# Primer: Days in AR

## Definition
Days in accounts receivable (also known as DAR or Days in A/R) is a common financial metric that measures the average amount of time it takes for money owed to a business entity to be collected from the responsible party for services rendered and billed.

As it’s name implies, the unit of measurement employed by this particular metric is days, or rather the average number of days from the moment that a service is provided until the bill is paid for that service. This number can tell you much about the financial health of the business.

For example, if an organization’s Days in A/R is 75, this means that, on average, it’s taking 75 days to collect it’s outstanding balances. From this, management can reasonably expect to need close to three months of working capital to meet the organization’s financial obligations. If Days in A/R continues to rise, this could put it into serious financial trouble.

On the other hand, an extremely low DAR is also undesirable. Though less common, an abnormally low number of days in A/R is cause for just as much concern as a high number.

The success of a practice’s billing operations is often measured in A/R days. The A/R balance can be reduced by receiving payments or by entering contractual or write off adjustments. It is important to manage the A/R balance as claims become much more difficult to collect the older they become. Good management of the A/R is also imperative to maintaining a good cash flow for the business. A poor A/R process can result in loss of money to the business and result in financial strains to the owners. If all these tasks are being done properly, the days in A/R number should be low, in contrast, high days in A/R number will most likely tell you there is a problem in your revenue cycle.

Good measure for how efficient a business is in managing A/R. A lower number represents a more efficient A/R process. A very useful measurement if adjustments and [[Write-Off|write-offs]] are being applied and managed correctly.

Monitoring and measuring AR in a medical practice is one of the most important indicators an entity’s leadership can use in maximizing value in the business. Analyzing days outstanding in AR essentially determines the average amount of discounted charges billed over a defined period (e.g. 30, 60, or 90 days). Average AR should not exceed an amount that encompasses a practice’s average monthly discounted charges.

A growing number of days in accounts receivable is symptomatic of a faulty billing process. 


This metric also depends on the medical specialty, patient demographics, payer mix, and CPT sample. Another downside is that this metric is sensitive to the provider because it counts the lag time of unsubmitted claims for services already delivered. This lag time roughly averages across all payers, making DAR an effective comparison metric between payers for an individual provider, but invalidating it across multiple providers.

One obvious advantage of the DAR metric is its independence of charges. The average feature of this metric eliminates sensitivity to a specific day or CPT, but it also hides the behavior shape of the [[accounts receivable]] curve.

In terms of medical practices, ratios pertaining to an organization’s outstanding AR figures (eg, days in AR) are a useful tool in measuring net working capital and ultimately assessing the profitability of the practice. However, it would not be appropriate to compare, for example, a cardiology group’s days of outstanding AR with that of a plastic surgery practice, because the most common methods of reimbursement are dramatically different between those two types of entities. This would not be an appropriate “apples-to-apples” comparison, and such accuracy in benchmarking criteria is the mortar that allows the bricks of analysis to firmly fit together and hold up to pressure.

One problem faced by most health care organizations is the timely collection of receivables (i.e., the money owed by insurance companies or patients to the health care organization for services rendered). Once receivables are collected, the money received can be used to pay off loans or be invested. This means that once money is received, either the organization would be paying less interest or it would be earning more interest. Therefore, organizations want to collect receivables promptly.

We often think of receivables in terms of how long it takes from billing to collection. A useful aid in analysis is to convert your patient revenue into a measure that represents the number of days in accounts receivable. Days in accounts receivable is an easy ratio to calculate and understand, once you break it down to its component parts. The numerator - net accounts receivable - is used as a proxy for the amount of money your patients and their insurers owe at any point in time, which you ultimately expect to collect. It is important to note that because this figure comes from the balance sheet, it technically is the value of accounts receivable on a specific day. We are therefore assuming that the last day of the fiscal year is a good representation of accounts receivable on any given day. If this is not a valid assumption, you can also calculate the average accounts receivable balance by taking the beginning of the year value plus the ending receivables value and dividing by two. This yields the “average” accounts receivable. Alternatively, you can find the average value of receivables at the end of each of the 12 months of the year.

The denominator in the DAR ratio is simply the annual patient revenue divided by the average revenue per day. Average receivables divided by the average revenue yields the number of days the average bill stays a receivable. For LCH, the DAR equals 77 (52,000,000 / (247,000,000 / 356)).

In other words, it is taking LCH 77 days to convert a bill into a cash collection. At first thought, you would think that you would want this ratio as low as possible. However, much like the current ratio, you want the DAR ratio neither too high nor too low. You really are striving for a middle ground, rather than far to one extreme. This is because

#### Accounts Receivable
[[Accounts Receivable]]
Money owed to the practice for services rendered and billed.

A/R is the total charges entered that have not been collected. It identifies charges that have been submitted to an insurance payer or patient but have not been paid. The A/R balance can be reduced by receiving payments or by entering contractual or [[write-off]] [[Adjustments]]. Claims become more difficult and costlier to collect the older they become.

Accounts receivable (A/R) represents money owed to the healthcare practice by patients and/or insurance carriers. The accounts receivable cycle begins with the delivery of service and continues until payment for the service is reconciled to a zero balance.

Accounts receivable management is a system that assists providers in the collection of the reimbursement for services rendered. The functions of [[accounts receivable]] management include insurance verification, insurance eligibility, [[prior authorization]], billing and claims submission, posting payments, and collections.

The accounts receivable department manages the amounts owed to a facility by patients who received services but whose payments will be made at a later date by the patients or guarantors or their third-party payers. After the claim is submitted to a TPP for reimbursement, the time allowed to remit a payment to accounts receivable begins. Typical performance statistics maintained by the accounts receivable department include days in AR and aging of accounts. Days in AR is calculated by dividing the ending AR balance for a given period by the average revenue per day. Facilities typically set performance goals for this standard.

#### Gross Charges
Gross charges, which can be considered the *full [[fee schedule]]* charges, are typically all charges generated by the practice, regardless of actual reimbursement or before discounting. Although gross charges are a valid method used to determine productivity within a practice from one provider to another, they have little relationship with bottom-line performance. A practice should be careful in using gross charges as a measurement or standard of productivity because they do not reflect the revenue collected by the practice. Gross charges are valid measurements of productivity but do not reflect actual financial performance.

#### Average Daily Charge
#### Aging
Aging of accounts is maintained in 30-day increments (0 - 30, 31 - 60, and so forth.) Facilities monitor the number of accounts and the total dollar value in each increment. The older the account or the longer the account remains unpaid, the less likely the facility will receive reimbursement for the encounter.

Most claims are originally billed to insurance, and until the insurance makes a payment, the responsibility for the payment continues to be with the insurance carrier. After the insurance carrier makes or denies a payment (and there is no just cause for an appeal), the responsibility for the balance of the account will switch to either the physician (to be written off) or to the patient (to be sent an invoice.)

Aging categorizes A/R according to the length of time charges have been outstanding as well as the responsible parties. These time periods are commonly 0 - 30 days, 31 - 60 days, 61 - 90 days, 91 - 120 days, and 121+ days. Aging is usually represented as a dollar amount and a percentage. 

Aging can be broken down by many metrics, such as provider, patient, insurance types (commercial, primary, secondary, worker’s comp, managed care), facility, diagnosis and procedural code, specialty, etc.

#### Claims Reconciliation and Collections
The last component of the revenue cycle is claims reconciliation and collections. The healthcare facility uses the EOB, MSN, and RA to reconcile accounts. In this process the facility compares expected reimbursement to the actual reimbursement provided by the TPP and patient. EOBs and MSNs identify the amount owed by the patient to the facility. Collections can contact the patient to collect outstanding deductibles and copayments. RAs indicate rejected or denied line items or whole claims. Facilities can review the RAs and determine whether the claim can be corrected and resubmitted for additional payment. If a correction is not warranted, reconciliation can be made via [[write-off]] or adjustment to the patient’s account. After the account has been settled, the revenue cycle is complete.

## Formula
[Days in AR Mathematical Formulas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_mvn82UlvaOBM86R1hFjkh0tpB4bRg0Kgip5AKykeu8/edit)

One way to determine DAR is to count the days from the date of service to the date of payment for every claim, and then average that across all claims. A simpler way to compute average number of days in AR is by taking a ratio of accounts receivable to average daily charges, or

Number of Days in Accounts Receivable = (Accounts Receivable / Average Charge) x 365

Days outstanding in AR is derived with the following formula:

Adjusted Charges for the Last n Months / Total Number of Days for n Months = Average Adjusted Revenue per Day
Alternatively, a practice can divide the total outstanding adjusted AR by average adjusted AR by average adjusted revenue per day to determine total days outstanding in AR.

As an example, if a practice’s total charges for the last 90 days were $380,000 and the total outstanding balance was $400,000, average adjusted revenue would be calculated with the following formula:

$380,000 / 90 days = $4,222
$400,000 / $4,222 = 94.74 days in AR

In this example, this ratio means that it takes the practice 95 days on average to collect it’s outstanding balances. This in turn tells management that at least three months of working capital is required to maintain the practice’s cash flow needs. Worded differently, if the practice is going to meet its financial obligations, it will need to have three months of cash reserves on hand for working capital purposes, or it will have to borrow these amounts, which will in turn have additional repercussions on the entity’s balance sheet.

Days in A/R is a fraction. The numerator is the total A/R. The denominator is average daily charges. Average daily charges are calculated by taking the total charges over the last 2 months (can also be one month) and dividing by the total number of days in those two (or one) months.

Example:

Total A/R = $200,000

Average Daily Charge = $4,250

Days in A/R = \$200,000/$4,250 = 47.06 days in A/R
