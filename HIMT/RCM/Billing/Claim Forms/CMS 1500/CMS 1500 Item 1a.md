# Item 1a
## Instructions
Enter the patient’s insurance ID number. This information is found on the patient’s insurance card. 
### Medicare
For Medicare, enter the Medicare beneficiary identifier (MBI) whether Medicare is the primary or secondary payer. This is a required field. The patient is always the subscriber for Medicare. A common Medicare electronic claim rejection is for an invalid MBI. 
### TRICARE
For TRICARE, enter the DoD Benefits Number (DBN 11-digit number). This is found on the back of the military ID card and is also known as the Electronic Data Interchange-Personal Identification number (EDI-PI). There is also a 10-digit DoD ID number on the front of the card. This is not the number used to submit claims. For BCBS, enter the member ID (for example, XYZ123456789, R12345678).
