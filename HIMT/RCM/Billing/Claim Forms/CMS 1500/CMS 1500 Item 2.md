# Item 2
## Instructions
Enter the patient’s last name, first name, and middle initial, if any, as shown on the patient’s insurance card. This is a required field. 

The name on the insurance card must match identically to the name on the claim form. Confirm the patient’s identity by verifying that the name on the insurance card and the name on the patient’s photo ID are identical. 

When a patient has a junior or senior suffix, the last name suffix is entered after the last name and before the first name. Professional suffixes and titles should not be included.
