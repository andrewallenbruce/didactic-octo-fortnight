# Healthcare Revenue Cycle Overview 

## Revenue Generation 
Businesses must generate revenue to remain open. A medical practice is a business just as any other and to remain open, it must provide services and generate revenue.  Yet it is one of the few businesses that does not get paid in full for the services rendered in real-time but must submit it’s invoices to a third party and then wait to receive reimbursement.

## Successful Revenue Cycle Process
1. Appointment Scheduling
	1. Friendly, knowledgeable staff
		1. Making an appt is the initial step in the revenue cycle
	2. Organize schedule for efficient patient flow
		1. Some offices charge for no show appts which can be an effective method of reinforcement. Read your payer’s policies before enforcing, educate the patient at first visit.
	3. Appointment reminders to reduce no shows
		1. Educate patient, should occur with every new patient.
	4. Use available technology
		1. Practice management systems have ways to track patient no-shows.
2. Registration
	1. Registration is a financial function. A receptionist creates the patient’s first impression of the practice, requires technical knowledge and should possess multi-tasking skills. Can cost up to $25 per claim to re-work and correct errors after they have been made at registration.
	2. Front Desk Collections
		1. If your office averages 20 patients a day for 48 weeks per year this is almost $100k a year. Collecting co-pays at the front desk is a crucial step in the revenue cycle.
		2. Knowing a patient’s insurance plan: Attempts to collect after the visit is very labor-intensive and expensive. Know a patient’s insurance plan and the amount of the plan’s co-pay. Confirming the patient’s copayment prior to arrival and providing this information to the front desk staff will streamline this process.
		3. Trained Staff: Staff also need to be trained to know how and when to ask for money. People have a very hard time asking for money if they have never done it before. The good news is, people can change their attitudes about collecting money if they become comfortable with it.
		4. Policies and scripts will help employees as they face those difficult situations collecting money. Policies provide the set of rules so that staff know what is expected and can rely on them rather than a feeling that they are enforcing collections efforts on their own. Scripting provides responses that can be used for difficult situations.
		5. Percentage of Co-Pay: Track the percentage of co-pays collected up front so that this important process can be managed. Also remember to monitor deductibles and co-insurances.
3. Charge Capture
	1. Charge capture can be done by coders, physicians, medical assistants, nurses, and billers.
	2. You must be aware of each payer’s policies as the method to obtain authorization may be different between payers.
		1. Create a policy for the number of days to post charges. This is the goal for the staff to work towards. A PMS can provide reports on days to post charges and missing charges.
4. Billing
	1. Timeliness and Accuracy: without a robust billing process, revenue will be delayed or lost.
	2. Electronic filing: most payers process secondary claims electronically, making it a very efficient method of submitting claims once the primary insurance has paid.
	3. Monitoring and reconciling: Identify lost claims or unsubmitted claims and lost revenue. Be familiar with the different claims files, claims status request and response, and front-end edits reports.
	4. Report claims statistics and reconciliation procedures on a monthly basis.
	5. Collections: Monitor fluctuations in collections revenue. If you notice unusually high or low activity in cash receipts look for unusual charge activity such as payments not posted in a timely manner or an uptick in payer denials.
	6. Write–Offs: Monitor adjustments to billed charges aka write-offs. Contractual adjustments are standard while administrative discounts may be different from practice to practice. Standardize adjustment codes. Common adjustment codes: Bad debt write off, cash discount, account correction.
5. Denial Management
	1. Review payer denial reason codes, payer-specific reports. Whether the reason is providing additional information to the payer, appealing the denial with the payer or requesting payment from the patient.
	2. Example Denial Report: ![](https://i.imgur.com/umhU8Kj.png)
		1. Identify Reason 
		2. Review Process
		3. Modify Process
		4. Educate Stakeholders
6. AR Follow-Up
	1. Total Charges entered that have not been collected. AR Management = imperative to maintain cash flow. Identify and follow up on charges that have been submitted to insurance but have not paid.

	5. Collecting from Payers
		1. Submit claims ASAP after DOS
			1. AR Timing Reports are usually based on DOS, delayed submission will add time to days to payment on reports.
		2. Ensure claims are submitted cleanly and properly
		3. Give priority to rejected or denied claims
		4. If claim needs to be appealed, ask for a decision maker on the payer side
			1. Spending time on the phone with representatives who cannot fix the problem will waste time and prevent work on other claims issues. Try to batch inquiries per insurer to save time.
		5. Regularly review AR reports
			1. A good AR report can batch outstanding account balances by insurance carrier to identify trends with a particular carrier and identify batches of claims to discuss when following up with a payer. The status of unpaid claims can often be verified on the payer’s website or through clearinghouse.
		6. Monitor payments from payers - verify being paid per contract
			1. Just because the payment and adjustment equal the total charge does not mean that the correct payment was made. Entering contracted amounts into the PMS or regularly auditing EOBs can verify that the practice is getting paid what it is entitled to and according to contract terms.
	6. Collecting from patients
		1. Assertiveness is key: ![](https://i.imgur.com/rZq4mBB.png)
		2. Consistency is important: ![](https://i.imgur.com/Cgv60Gw.png)
		3. Provide various payment solutions: ![](https://i.imgur.com/IoGIW1E.png)
		4. Providers generally do not want to send their past due accounts on to collection agencies: ![](https://i.imgur.com/MhP4Aov.png)
