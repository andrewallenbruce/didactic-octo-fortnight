# A A (Attribute authority)
A directory or database in which systems can securely add, modify, and save attributes. An attribute authority is a trusted source of data for attribute-based access control (ABAC) decisions.
 
# A A A (Authentication, authorization, and accounting)
A principle that is the cornerstone of security, whether IT or otherwise, and is comprised of access control, authentication, and accounting. 
 
# ABAC (Attribute-based access control)
A logical access control model that is distinguishable because it controls access to objects by evaluating rules against the attributes of the entities (subject and object) actions and the environment relevant to a request.
 
# ABC (Activity-based costing)
An accounting technique that allows an organization to determine the actual cost associated with each product and service produced by the organization, without regard to organizational structure. A cost accounting approach concerned with matching costs with activities (called cost drivers) that cause those costs. It is a more sophisticated kind of absorption-costing and replaces labor-based costing systems. ABC states that

1. products consume activities
2. it is the activities (and not the products) that consume resources
3. activities are the cost drivers, and
4. activities are not necessarily based on the volume of production.

 Instead of allocating costs to cost centers (such as manufacturing, marketing, finance), ABC allocates direct and indirect costs to activities such as processing an order, attending to a customer complaint, or setting up a machine.
 
# ABC codes (Alternative billing codes)
 Terminology to describe alternative medicine, nursing, and other integrative healthcare interventions that include relative value units and legal scope of practice information. ABC codes are five-digit Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant alpha codes (e.g., AAAAA) used by licensed and non-licensed healthcare practitioners on standard healthcare claim forms (e.g., CMS 1500 Form) to describe services, remedies, and/or supply items provided and/or used during patient visits.
 
 # Abend
 Abnormal termination of software. 1. A type of system error in which a task or program fails to execute properly (i.e., “ab-normally ends”). The term is also used as the name for a type of error message that indicates such a failure has occurred. 2. ABnormal END or ABortive END. System crash or other abnormal termination of a computer program caused by memory conflict or some other (usually unidentifiable) glitch.
 
 # Abort
 In data transmission, an abort is a function invoked by a sending station to cause the recipient to discard or ignore all bit sequences transmitted by the sender since the preceding flag sequence. To terminate a program or process abnormally and usually suddenly, with or without diagnostic information.
 
 # Abstract message
 The basic level of definition within HL7 is that of the abstract message associated with a particular trigger event. The abstract message includes the data fields that will be sent within a message, the valid response messages, and the treatment of application level errors or the failure of the underlying communications system. An HL7 abstract message is defined in terms of HL7 segments and fields.
 
 # Abstract syntax
 A form of representation of data that is independent of machine-oriented structures and encodings and also of the physical representation of the data. Abstract syntax is used to give a high-level description of programs being compiled or messages passing over a communications link.
 
# Abstract syntax notation
See ASN
 
# Abstracting
An application that facilitates the collection and maintenance of coded patient information with selected patient demographic, clinical, and admissions data from the medical record, usually post-discharge. This information can be used for internal control, analysis, regulatory reports, etc.

# Abstraction
1. The process of extracting essential properties while omitting unessential details.
	 
2. The process of taking away or removing characteristics from something in order to reduce it to a set of essential characteristics. In object-oriented programming, abstraction is one of three central principles (along with encapsulation and inheritance). Through the process of abstraction, a programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.
 
 # ACA (Affordable Care Act)
 On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which sought to extend healthcare coverage to more individuals and makes coverage more affordable for many others. Section 1561 requested the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), in consultation with the Health Information Technology (HIT) Policy Committee, and the HIT Standards Committee (the Committees), to develop interoperable and secure standards and protocols that facilitate electronic enrollment of individuals in federal and state health and human services programs.

In general, for new applications, the use of objectoriented programming and actual or de facto standard development tools and interfaces (such as Java or .NET) will help ensure that new application programs can be easily integrated with those that may be needed in the future. The Extensible Markup Language (XML) promises to serve as a tool for exchanging data among disparate programs in a standard way.^2 Application layer: See OSI. Layer 7 of the OSI (open systems interconnection) model. Responsible for information transfer between two network applications.

A number of background processes can be running on a multitasking operating system, such as Linux, while the user is interacting with the foreground process. Some background processes, such as daemons, for example, never require user input. Others are merely in the background temporarily while the user is busy with the program presently running in the foreground so that other processes can be sleeping and taking up swap space, until activated, which thus makes it currently a background process.^33 Backup: A copy of files and programs made to facilitate recovery, if necessary.^1 Backup domain controller: See BDC.

In direct sequence spread spectrum, the stream of information to be transmitted is divided into small pieces, each of which is allocated to a frequency channel across the spectrum. A data signal at the point of transmission is combined with a higher data-rate bit sequence (also known as a chipping code) that divides the data according to a spreading ratio. The redundant chipping code helps the signal resist interference and also enables the original data to be recovered if data bits are damaged during transmission.^2 DSTU (Draft standard for trial use): A standard or implementation specification released to allow implementers to test the standard.

Dumb terminals are used by airlines, banks, and other such firms for inputting data to, and recalling it from, the connected computer.^4 **Durability:** A database property that ensures transactions are saved permanently and do not accidentally disappear or get erased, even during a database crash. This is usually achieved by saving all transactions to a nonvolatile storage medium. Durability is part of the ACID acronym, which stands for atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. ACID is a set of properties guaranteeing the reliability of all database transactions.^52 _See_ **ACID**. **Durable medical equipment:** _See_ **DME**. **DVD (Digital video disk or digital versatile disk):** A type of optical media used for storing digital data.

 resources. Virtualization can be viewed as part of an overall trend in enterprise IT that includes autonomic computing, a scenario in which the IT environment will be able to manage itself based on perceived activity, and utility computing, in which computer processing power is seen as a utility that clients can pay for only as needed. The usual goal of virtualization is to centralize administrative tasks while improving scalability and workloads.^2 Virtualization software: Virtualization software acts as a layer between a computer’s primary OS and the virtual OS. It allows the virtual system to access the computer’s hardware, such as the R AM, CPU, and video card, just like the primary OS. This is different than emulation, which actually translates each command into a form that the system’s processor can understand. Since Apple and Windows® computers now both use the “x86” processor architecture, it is possible to run both OSes on the same machine via virtualization, rather than emulation.^73 Virus: Software used to infect a computer. After the virus code is written, it is buried within an existing program. Once that program is executed, the virus code is activated and attaches copies of itself to other programs in the computer and other computers in the network. Infected programs continue to propagate the virus, which is how it spreads. A virus cannot run by itself; it requires that its host program be run to make the virus active.15 0,1 Vishing (voice or VoIP phishing): An electronic fraud tactic in which individuals are tricked into revealing critical financial or personal information to unauthorized entities.

The term VMR has historically been used in the CDS community to refer to a simplified representation of the clinical record that is suitable and safe for a CDS knowledge engineer to directly manipulate in order to derive patient-specific assessments and recommendations. Historically, the challenge has been that different organizations used different VMRs. The purpose of the VMR effort is to define a standard VMR that can be used across CDS implementations. Moreover, due to the intended use of the VMR, a primary goal is simple and intuitive representation of data that is easy and safe for a typical CDS knowledge engineer to understand, use, and implement.^9 **Voice ID (voice authentication):** A type of user authentication that uses voice print biometrics.
