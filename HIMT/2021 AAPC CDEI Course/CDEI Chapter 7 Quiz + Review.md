## Clinical Conditions & Diagnosis Coding Pt. 1

### A 27-year-old female was brought to the emergency room by her brother. She has a history of severe depression, manic-depressive psychosis, , and migraine headaches. Her home medications include Lithium and Midrin which was continued during admission. During the past week, she became manic, running all her credit cards to the limit, getting inappropriately involved in a friend’s suicide attempt, quitting her job, and trying to take over the pulpit at church. Earlier today, she threatened to strike the telephone repairman with a lead pipe. She was admitted for Lithium adjustment. Admission diagnoses are mild manic-depressive bipolar with circular current manic state, and migraine. What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- F31.62, G43.911
- F31.32,  G43.909
- F31.89, G43.911
- ==F31.11,  G43.909==

>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Disorder/bipolar/current (or most recent) episode/manic/without psychotic features/mild, guiding you to code F31.11. No code assignment is necessary for depression because depression is a component of bipolar disorder. Although not a psychiatric condition, the migraine headaches are a coexisting condition under treatment and should be coded. In the Alphabetic Index, look for Migraine, directing you to code G43.90-. Verify the codes in the Tabular List. When reviewing code G43.90 in the Tabular List, a 6 th character of 9 is selected because there is no mention of an intractable migraine or status migrainosus.

### A patient was diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) of the inferior wall which converted to a NSTEMI after thrombolytic therapy. What ICD-10-CM code is reported?

- ==I21.19==
- I21.29
- I22.0
- I22.8

>**Rationale**: According to ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.9.e.1, the ICD-10-CM codes for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) identify the site, such as anterolateral wall or true posterior wall. The same section goes on to state that if STEMI converts to NSTEMI due to thrombolytic therapy, it is still coded as STEMI. Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Infarct, infarction/myocardium, myocardial (acute) (with stated duration of 4 weeks or less)/ST elevation (STEMI)/inferior (diaphragmatic) (inferolateral) (Q wave) (wall), which directs you to I21.19. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### A 63-year-old patient is a direct admission from his primary care physician’s office for hypertension and cardiac septal defect. The two conditions are unrelated. What ICD-10-CM code(s) is/are reported?

- I11.0, I51.0
- ==I10, I51.0==
- I51.0		
- I11.9, I51.0

>**Rationale**: According to ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.9.a.1 if the documentation does not have a causal relationship between the hypertension and heart disease, the conditions are coded separately. Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Hypertension, referring you to I10. Then look for defect and refer to subterm septal (heart), acquired, which directs you to I51.0. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### A patient is admitted to the hospital for erythropoietin resistant anemia due to stage 2 chronic kidney disease. The patient is treated with B-12. What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- D63.1, N18.2
- ==N18.2, D63.1==
- D63.8, N18.9
- N18.9, D63.8

>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Anemia/in (due to) (with)/chronic kidney disease or Anemia/erythropoietin resistant anemia (EPO resistant anemia), guiding you to code D63.1. In the Tabular List at D63.1 there is an instructional note stating to code first underlying chronic kidney disease. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Disease, diseased/kidney/chronic/stage 2 (mild), guiding you to code N18.2. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### An 84-year-old patient with a documented history in the past few months of being combative and aggressive in the nursing home is admitted for evaluation of her irritable behavior. The provider diagnoses the patient with dementia and consults a neurologist for further evaluation on her combative and aggressive behavior that she has been displaying. What ICD-10-CM code(s) is/are reported?

- F03.90
- ==F03.91==		
- F03.90, R45.4
- F03.91, R45.4

>**Rationale**: In ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Dementia/with/aggressive behavior, directing you to F03.91. Next, look for Dementia/with/combative behavior, directing you to F03.91. Verify the codes in the Tabular List. Both manifestations are reported with the same code, so it is only reported once according to ICD-10-CM guideline I.B.12. No need to add additional code for the symptom of anger.

### What are the ICD-10-CM codes that would be reported for hypertension with stage 2 chronic kidney disease?

- N18.9, I12.3
- ==I12.9, N18.2==
- N18.3, I12.9
- I12.9, N18.9

>**Rationale**: Per ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.9.a.2 assign codes from category I12, Hypertensive chronic kidney disease, when both hypertension and a condition classified to category N18, Chronic kidney disease, are present. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Hypertension/kidney/with/stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease which directs you to code I12.9. In the Tabular List, there is a note to use an additional code to identify the stage of chronic kidney disease (N18.1-N18.4 or N18.9). Look in the Alphabetic Index for Disease, diseased/kidney/chronic/stage 2 (mild), directing you to code N18.2. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### A 48-year-old-male patient has developed an ulcer on his left lower leg. He has had diabetes for several years and is on insulin. The provider determines that the ulcer is due to his diabetes. What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- E11.622, Z79.4
- E11.9, L97.929, Z79.4
- E11.622, L97.929
- ==E11.622, L97.929, Z79.4==

>**Rationale**: ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.4.a.2 indicates if the type of diabetes is not documented in the medical record the default type is 2. ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.4.a.3 indicates the use of insulin does not mean that a patient is a type 1 diabetic. If the documentation indicates that the patient uses insulin, but does not indicate the type of diabetes, you report type 2. For type 2 patients, code Z79.4 is reported to indicate long-term use of insulin. The ulcer is due to the diabetes. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Diabetes, diabetic (mellitus) (sugar)/with/skin ulcer NEC, which directs you to E11.622. In the Tabular List E11.622 has a note to use an additional code to identify the site of the ulcer. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Ulcer/left lower leg, which directs the coder to L97.929. The severity of the ulcer is not provided. Also look for Long-term (current) (prophylactic) drug therapy (use of)/insulin, which directs you to Z79.4. Verify code selections in the Tabular List.

### A patient is admitted for hypertension with stage 5 CKD and myocardial disease. The myocardial disease is unrelated to the hypertension. What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- ==I12.0, N18.5, I51.5==
- I10, N18.5, 151.5
- I12.0, I51.5
- I13.11, N18.5

>**Rationale**: ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.9.a.2 indicates that ICD-10-CM presumes a causal relationship between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension. Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Hypertension/kidney/stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end stage renal disease (ESRD), referring you to I12.0. An instructional note under I12.0 indicates to use an additional code to identify the stage of the CKD. Code N18.5 is reported for stage 5 CKD. ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.9.a.1 indicates that if the documentation does not have a causal relationship between the hypertension and heart disease, the conditions are coded separately. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Disease/myocardium, myocardial, referring you to I51.5. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### A 46-year-old patient is seen in the ED after prolonged chest pain. Cardiac enzymes are elevated and EKG is abnormal. A decision was made to admit the patient and perform a cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography. Left heart catheterization was performed in order to perform a left ventriculogram. He tolerated the procedure well and will be discharged. His final diagnosis is systolic heart failure exacerbation and hypertension. The two conditions are unrelated. What ICD-10-CM code(s) is/are reported?

- I11.0
- I11.0, I50.23
- ==I50.23, I10==		
- I11.0, I10

>**Rationale**: ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.9.a.1 indicates when the documentation specifically states the two conditions are unrelated between hypertension and heart disease, they are coded separately. In this case, there is no causal relationship coded. Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Failure/heart/systolic (congestive)/acute on chronic (congestive), directing you to I50.23. Then, look for Hypertension, which directs you to I10. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### A 27-year-old patient with type 2 diabetes has with diabetic macular edema and proliferative diabetic retinopathy in the left eye. What ICD-10-CM code(s) is/are reported?

- E11.312, E11.3519
- E11.3519
- ==E11.3512==
- E11.9, E11.312, E11.3519

>**Rationale**: Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index Diabetes, diabetic (mellitus) (sugar)/type2/with/retinopathy/proliferative/with macular edema, which directs you to E11.351-. There is a checkmark next to the code in the Alphabetic Index reminding the coder to check the Tabular List for the 7 th character to show laterality. From the Tabular List, assign 7 th character 1 to identify the left eye.

### An 83-year-old patient is admitted after being found unresponsive at home. The patient had right-sided hemiplegia and aphasia from a previous CVA. The provider documents a current cerebral infarction due to occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery as the final diagnosis and the patient is transferred for rehabilitation. What ICD-10-CM code(s) is/are reported?

- I65.319
- I67.89, I69.954, R47.01		
- ==I63.512, I69.351, I69.320==
- I67.89, I69.959, I69.920

>**Rationale**: Refer to ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.9.d.2. Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Infarct, infarction/cerebral/due to/occlusion NEC/cerebral arteries, directing you to code I63.5-. Report I63.512 Cerebral infarct due to unspecified occlusion or stenosis of left middle cerebral artery. This patient has a history of CVA with right-sided hemiplegia and aphasia. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Sequelae (of)/infarction/cerebral/hemiplegia, which directs the coder to I69.35-. Also look for Sequelae/infarction/cerebral/aphasia I69.320. Verify in the Tabular List I69.351 Hemiplegia and hemiparesis following cerebral infarction affecting right dominant side. Per ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.9.d.1 because the right side was affected and we do not know the dominant side, the default for dominance is right.

### A 36-year-old patient is brought in by EMS having convulsions. The patient is admitted and a full workup is completed. After study it is determined the convulsions were due to alcohol abuse with intoxication. What ICD-10-CM code(s) is/are reported?

- F10.129		
- ==R56.9, F10.129==
- G40.501, R56.9, F10.129		
- G40.509, F10.120

>**Rationale**: There is no indication that the convulsions were an epileptic seizure, so a code from subcategory G40.50- is not reported. The convulsions were brought on by the intake of alcohol. Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Convulsions, directing you to code R56.9. Documentation states alcohol abuse, not alcoholism with intoxication. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Abuse/alcohol/with/intoxication, directing you to F10.129. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### A 58-year-old patient is admitted for confusion and memory loss. The provider diagnoses the patient with late onset Alzheimer’s disease with dementia. What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- G30.1, F02.80, F29, R41.3
- F02.80, G30.0
- ==G30.1, F02.80==		
- F02.80, G30.0, F29, R41.3
 
>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, look for Alzheimer’s diseases or sclerosis and you are directed to see Disease, Alzheimer’s. Look for Disease, diseased/Alzheimer’s/late onset, which directs you to G30.0 [F02.80]. The code in brackets indicates a manifestation code. When we verify the G30.1 code in the Tabular List there is an instructional note under code section G30 that confirms that we should code also the dementia. F02.80 is the correct code because the provider does not mention any behavioral disturbances. Sequencing rules tell us that the manifestation code always follows the etiology code. Codes F29 Psychosis and R41.3 Memory loss are not reported because these are signs and symptoms of Alzheimer’s. See ICD-10-CM guideline I.B.4.

### An interventional radiologist performed a thoracentesis on a patient while admitted in the hospital. The patient has advanced left lung cancer that has metastasized to the pleura with malignant pleural effusion. Later the same day, due to continued accumulation of fluid, the patient was returned to the procedure room and the same provider performed a repeat thoracentesis. What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- C78.2, C34.92
- ==C78.2, C34.92, J91.0==
- C34.92, C78.2, J91.0		
- J91.0

>**Rationale**: The patient has malignant pleural effusion. Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Effusion/pleura, pleurisy, pleuritic, pleuropericardial/malignant, directing you to code J91.0. In the Tabular List there is a note under J91.0 to code the malignant neoplasm first, if known. In this case, it is known. According to ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.2.b, when treatment is directed to the secondary cancer, the secondary cancer is reported first. The primary cancer is reported second. Treatment is due to the accumulation of fluid due to metastasis to the pleura. Look in the ICD-10-CM Table of Neoplasms for Neoplasm, neoplastic/pleura, pleural (cavity) and use the code from the Malignant Secondary column, which directs the coder to C78.2. The primary malignancy should also be reported. Look in the Table of Neoplasms for Neoplasm, neoplastic/lung and use the code from the Malignant Primary column, which directs the coder to C34.9-. In the Tabular List, 5 th character 2 is selected for the left lung. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### A patient with metastatic bone cancer (primary site unknown) is admitted for chemotherapy treatment. On examination the oncologist finds the patient to be severely anemic. The chemotherapy is cancelled. The patient receives a blood transfusion as an inpatient.  Chemotherapy is rescheduled for a subsequent admission. Diagnosis given is anemia due to metastatic bone cancer. What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- C40.30, D64.9, C79.51
- D63.0, C79.51, C80.1
- ==C79.51, C80.1, D63.0==		
- D64.9, C80.1, C79.51

>**Rationale**: Per ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.2.c.2 when the admission/encounter is for management of anemia due to the malignancy, and only the anemia is being treated (blood transfusion), the malignancy is sequenced first, followed by the code for the anemia. The treatment is directed at the bone cancer or the metastatic site.  In the ICD-10-CM Table of Neoplasms look for Neoplasm, neoplastic/bone. Use the code from the Malignant Secondary column, directing you to code C79.51. Also in the Table of Neoplasms look for unknown or unspecified site and use the code from the Malignant Primary column, which directs the coder to C80.1. Verify the code selections in the Tabular List. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Anemia and refer to subterm in (due to) and select neoplastic disease D63.0.

### An elderly male patient presents to the ED complaining of a high fever the day prior to the encounter and of extreme lethargy. He has a history of benign hypertension which has been elevated. On arrival he was examined and admitted, with possible septic urinary tract infection and concern for  elevated blood pressure, severe chest pain, and some anxiety. This could be possibly due to hypertensive crisis. He was noted to have hematuria and a urine culture is performed. Positive UTI and E. coli  showed in the urine culture and IV antibiotics were administered. During the course of the day, his fever decreased and his lethargy improved. As the IV fluids were decreased, he resumed a benign hypertensive state. On the next hospital day, his primary care physician noted the urine was clear and he was discharged on oral antibiotics, with septicemia and hypertensive crisis ruled out. What ICD-10-CM codes should be reported?

- A41.52, N39.0, I16.9, I10
- ==N39.0, B96.20, I10==
- B96.20, N39.0, I16.9, I10, R31.9		
- A41.9, I10, R31.9, N39.0

>**Rationale**: Per ICD-10-CM guideline IV.H Uncertain Diagnosis, we would not code diagnoses documented as probable, suspected, questionable, rule out or working diagnosis, or other similar terms indicating uncertainty. During the course of the patient’s stay septicemia and hypertensive crisis was ruled out and would not be coded. The reason for the visit was to treat the urinary tract infection, making that code primary. Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Infection/urinary (tract) NEC, directing you to code N39.0. Look in the Tabular List for code N39.0. There is an instructional note stating, “Use additional code to identify infectious agent.” This note must always be followed when the organism is known. The note states “E. coli showed in the urine culture.” Look in the Alphabetic Index for Infection/unspecified E. coli/as cause of disease classified elsewhere, which directs you to B96.20. Hematuria (R31.9) is integral to a urinary tract infection and is not reported separately. Hypertension is coded because it is a coexisting condition that was being affected by having the UTI. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Hypertension, which directs you to I10. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### A 22-year-old patient with amyloidosis being treated for neuritis. What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- E85.3, G63
- G63, E85.4
- G63, E85.3		
- ==E85.4, G63==

>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Neuritis/in (due to)/amyloidosis, guiding you to codes E85.4 [G63]. In the Alphabetic Index the brackets identify manifestation codes. In the Tabular List code N08 has an instructional note to code first underlying disease, such as amyloidosis (E85.-). Your primary code is E85.4 for Amyloidosis, followed by G63 for the manifested Neuritis. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### Friends brought a 17-year-old male with type 1 diabetes to the emergency department in an unconscious state. He was admitted with ketoacidosis with coma and was resuscitated with saline hydration via insulin drip. The patient later reported that the morning of admission he experienced nausea and vomiting and decided not to take his insulin because he had not eaten. He was treated with intravenous hydration and insulin drip. By the following morning, his laboratory work was within normal range and he was experiencing no symptoms. What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- E11.01, R06.4
- E10.10, R06.4, Z79.4
- E11.01, Z79.4		
- ==E10.11==

>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Diabetes, diabetic (mellitus) (sugar)/type 1/with/ketoacidosis/with coma, guiding you to code E10.11. Code Z79.4 Long term use of insulin is not required for a type 1 diabetic because these patients are insulin dependent. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### An HIV positive patient was admitted with lesions on the palate. Biopsies were performed and identified HIV related Kaposi’s sarcoma.  Leukoplakia of the lips and hepatomegaly were also noted on physical examination. Discharge diagnoses: (1) HIV infection, (2) Kaposi’s sarcoma, palate, (3) leukoplakia, and (4) hepatomegaly. What ICD-10-CM codes should be reported?

- ==B20, C46.2, K13.21, R16.0==
- Z21, C46.2, K13.21, R16.0
- B20, C46.0, K13.21, R16.0, Z21		
- R16.1, C46.0, Z21

>**Rationale**: According to ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.1.a.2.a, if a patient is admitted for an HIV-related condition, the principal diagnosis should be B20, followed by additional diagnosis codes for all reported HIV-related conditions. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Human/immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease (infection), leading to B20. Because Kaposi’s sarcoma is neoplastic lesions caused by an opportunistic infection common in HIV, it is coded as AIDS instead of asymptomatic HIV (Z21). In the Alphabetic Index look for Kaposi’s/sarcoma/palate, directing you to C46.2. For leukoplakia look for Leukoplakia/lip, directing you to K13.21. Look for Hepatomegaly, directing you to R16.0. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### A 22-year-old patient developed a superficial postoperative infection following a recent surgical procedure. The patient became septic, blood cultures came back positive for enterococcus, and the patient went into postprocedural septic shock. What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- T81.41XA, T81.44XA, T81.12XA, R65.21, A41.81
- A41.81, R65.21, T81.44XA, T81.41XA
- R65.21, A41.81, T81.12XA, T81.44XA		
- ==T81.41XA, T81.44XA, T81.12XA, A41.81==

>**Rationale**: ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.1.d.5.c states when a postprocedural infection has resulted in postprocedural septic shock, the code for the precipitating complication, such as code T81.4- Infection following a procedure is coded first, followed by code T81.12- Procedural septic shock. A code for the systemic infection should also be assigned. First, go to the Alphabetic Index and look for Infection/postoperative wound/surgical site/superficial, which leads to code T84.41. Verify the code in the Tabular List to apply one character X as a placeholder and select the 7 th character of A for intial as patient is still receiving treatment. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Sepsis/postprocedural referring you to T81.44-. Verifying this code in the Tabular List shows that you need to place two X placeholders and select the 7th character of A since the treatment is active. The complete code is T81.44XA. The Tabular List for T81.4 has an instructional note to code the infection. For the systemic infection look in the Alphabetic Index for Sepsis/enterococcus, which directs you to A41.81. Guideline I.C.1.d.5.c. shows that the systemic infection should also be assigned, but it does not state the order; however, coding guideline I.C.1.d.2 Septic shock indicates that the systemic infection is sequenced first, followed by T81.12- Postprocedural shock. Report T81.12- as the next code. Verifying the code in the Tabular List tells you to add the X placeholder as the 6th character and choose the 7th character of A. Code R65.21 is not reported as instructed in coding guideline I.C.1.d.5.c; also code T81.12- already indicates septic shock and there is an Excludes1 note under subcategory code T81.1- stating not to report code R65.21.

### A 33-year-old patient is being admitted today for laparoscopic gastric bypass due to severe morbid obesity. The patient’s current caloric intake is in excess of 4,000 calories per day and his BMI is currently 58. What ICD-10-CM code(s) is/are reported?

- E66.3
- E66.01, Z68.42
- ==E66.01, Z68.43==		
- E66.3, Z68.42

>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Obesity/morbid, guiding you to code E66.01. In the Tabular List there is note under subcategory code E66 to use an additional code to identify the BMI (Z68.1-Z68.45). Look at this range in the Tabular List. The second code is Z68.43, indicating a BMI of 50.0-59.9 adult. This can be found in the Alphabetic Index by looking for Body, bodies/mass index (BMI)/adult/50.0-59.9, referring you to Z68.43. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### A patient is admitted and treated for secondary diabetic ketoacidosis without coma due to malignant neoplasm of the pancreatic body. The patient uses insulin routinely. What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- E13.11, C25.1
- E11.11, C25.2, Z79.4
- ==C25.1, E08.10, Z79.4==
- C25.9, E08.10

>**Rationale**: The patient’s diabetes is due to the pancreatic cancer as an underlying condition. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Diabetes, diabetic (mellitus) (sugar)/due to underlying condition/with/ketoacidosis/without coma leading to E08.10. In the Tabular List, under category code E08, an instructional note indicates to code the underlying condition first. In the Table of Neoplasms look for Neoplasm, neoplastic/pancreas/body and select the code from the Malignant Primary column, which directs the coder to C25.1. There is also coding guidance under category code E08 to use an additional code for patients who routinely use insulin. Report code Z79.4 which is found in the Alphabetic Index under Long-term (current) (prophylactic) drug therapy (use of)/insulin. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### A 43-year-old patient arrived to the ED with severe shortness of breath progressing to respiratory failure. The patient’s desats were at 85%. He was intubated and admitted for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Chest X-ray shows he has left pleural effusion. What ICD-10-CM code(s) is/are reported?

- ==J96.01, J90==
- J96.00		
- J94.0, J96.01
- J94.0, J96.00, R09.1

>**Rationale**: According to ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.10.b.1, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure can be a primary diagnosis with another acute diagnosis if it is clear the respiratory failure was responsible for the patient being admitted. Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Failure/respiration, respiratory/acute, hypoxic, leading to J96.0-. Then, in the Alphabetic Index, look for Effusion/chest, which directs you to see Effusion, pleura. Effusion/pleura, pleurisy, pleuritic, pleuropericardial directs you to J90. Confirm code selection in the Tabular List.

### Mrs. Smith is admitted for pain management of her metastatic cancer. She  recieves an intercostal nerve block to treat the debilitating pain of her malignancy. Her cancer has metastasized to her bladder. What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- ==G89.3, C79.11, C80.1==
- M54.6, C79.11, C80.1
- C79.11, G89.3, C80.1		
- C79.11, G89.3, M54.6, C80.1

>**Rationale**: The reason for this encounter is pain management. According to ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.6.b.5, pain in neoplastic disease (G89.3) is the first-listed diagnosis when the reason for the encounter is documented as pain control or pain management. The patient has metastatic cancer (secondary malignancy) of the thoracic spine. Look in the ICD-10-CM Table of Neoplasms for Neoplasm, neoplastic/bladder and use the code from the Malignant Secondary column, directing you to code C79.11. The primary cancer is unknown, so report code C80.1. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### A 69-year-old female patient presents to the ED for a lower respiratory infection diagnosed the previous week. Her condition has not improved and her cough has gotten worse. She has a long history of smoking. She currently smokes one pack a day and is dependent on the cigarettes. She uses a bronchodilator for her COPD. She is admmited for IV antibiotics for her acute bronchitis and to manage her COPD which is exacerbated. What ICD-10-CM codes are reported for this visit?

- J44.0, J44.1, J21.9, F17.210
- J44.9, J20.9, Z72.0
- ==J44.0, J44.1 J20.9, F17.210==		
- J44.0, Z72.0

>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Disease, diseased/pulmonary/chronic obstructive/with/lower respiratory infection (acute) leading to J44.0. While in the same area of the Index notice the code for the exacerbation J44.1. Verify both selections in the Tabular List. In the Tabular List, there is an instruction note to code also the infection. For this example, the infection is reported with a code from category code J20 acute bronchitis. In the Alphabetic Index under bronchitis/ acute you are directed to J20.9. In the Tabular List category J44 has a note to code also the type of asthma, which is not applicable to this case so it is not coded. J44 also has a note to report an additional code for use of or exposure to smoke. The patient is currently still smoking and is dependent on cigarettes. Look for Dependence (on)/nicotine/cigarettes, leading to F17.210. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### Which of the following is a type of encephalopathy?

- Pulmonary encephalopathy
- Lymphatic encephalopathy
- Excessive caloric encephalopathy
- ==Toxic encephalopathy==

>**Rationale**: Encephalopathy can be caused by infectious agents, brain tumors, increased pressure in the skull, prolonged exposure to toxic elements, poor nutrition, or lack of oxygen or blood flow to the brain. The most common types of encephalopathy include toxic, anoxic, and hepatic encephalopathy.

### Which of the following is NOT factor that should be reported as an ICD-10-CM code in conjunction with a patient’s diagnosis of cancer or use to complete the nature of the patient’s case?

- Family history of malignancy
- ==Family history of long-term drug therapy==
- Estrogen receptor status
- Acquired absence of organs

>**Rationale**: Family history of drug therapy is not indicative of reporting. Exposure to tobacco smoke by family would be, but otherwise only a personal history of medications is reported.

### Which of the following is NOT a sign or symptom of sepsis?
 
- Body temperature above 101F
- Difficulty breathing
- ==Respiratory rate of 15==
- Decrease in platelet count

>**Rationale**: All, but the respiratory rate of 15 are signs and symptoms of sepsis.

### Which of the following symptoms is seen in a bleed that originates in the upper gastrointestinal tract?

- ==Hematemesis==
- Elevated temperature
- Elevated blood pressure
- Erythema

>**Rationale**: Hematemesis is more commonly seen in upper GI bleeds. In severe GI bleeds hypotension can be seen. Erythema is caused with then blood vessels dilate which is often not the case in patients who are hemorrhaging, instead a pale complexion is common.

### CASE 1 Discharge Diagnoses
#### 1. Major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe
#### 2. HIV
#### 3. Herpes
#### 4. COPD

Susan Burrows is a 41-year-old divorced female who was admitted for worsening depression with a history of 2 suicide attempts in the last year. Patient presents with suicidal ideation. Stressors included the patient receiving a diagnosis of HIV last spring and then shortly after, dealing with being terminated from her job of 18 years. A more acute stressor is her ongoing and worsening arguments with her boyfriend Brian which led to this hospital stay.

**Hospital Course**:  The patient was admitted and stabilized in the unit. Records have been obtained from her doctor’s office where the patient is being followed for her HIV. Fluconazole, Dapsone, and Stribild are to be continued. For her herpes she will continue on Valtrex. The patient has Albuterol for her COPD. Regarding her psychotropic medications for major depression, the patient was agreeable to get back onto a basic antidepressant trial. The patient in recent months had been on Prozac but did not feel that helpful so it was discontinued. She was started on Wellbutrin SR which was increased up to 150 mg p.o. b.i.d., taken morning and afternoon, and generally well tolerated. Overall, the patient reported feeling better on her medications, calmer, less depressed, and more in control. The patient did well during her inpatient stay. She interacted well in both individual and group therapy. She processed a lot about her issues with her boyfriend Brian and decided that the relationship does need to come to an end. The patient has strong support in contacts within the local police service, if needed, to help facilitate the boyfriend being removed safely from the home. The patient denied any further thoughts of harming herself and was very positive about moving forward in life.

**Discharge Medications:** Multivitamin, Fluconazole, Valtrex, Stribild, Dapsone, and Wellbutrin

**Discharge Plan:** The patient will return to live at home as prior to admission. She was given information on the local depression support groups.

For the suicidal ideation begin in the Alphabetic Index under Ideation/suicidal leading to code R45.850. For the history of suicide attempts begin in the Alphabetic Index under History/personal/suicide attempt leading to Z91.5. Verify all codes in the Tabular List.

### CASE 2 Discharge Diagnoses
#### 1. Fistula
#### 2. Abdominal wall abscess
#### 3. Sigmoid cancer w/ mets to liver

**Hospital Course:** Samuel Peterson is a 59-year-old male who recently underwent a total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy for obstructing sigmoid cancer. Recently he noticed feculent material coming out a wound two inches above his midline incision and presented to the emergency department because of this. Oncology was consulted with regard to chemotherapy while his enterocutaneous fistula heals. His chemo will be delayed until it heals. Interventional radiology was consulted to place a drain in for his abdominal abscess. His fistula output decreased, and he continued to have good ostomy function and drainage from his drain. His pain was controlled. No nausea or vomiting.

>**Rationale**: The patient presents with acute gangrenous cholecystitis. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, look for Cholecystitis/gangrenous. You are then directed to “see cholecystitis/acute” K81.0. Verify code selection in the Tabular List. An instructional note indicates to use an additional code for associated gangrene of the gallbladder, K82.A1. He is also diagnosed with a secondary malignant neoplasm of the tail of the pancreas. Look in the malignant secondary column of the Table of Neoplasms for Pancreas/tail C78.89. According to ICD-10-CM Guidelines, Section I.C.2.d. states that when a primary malignancy has been previously excised or eradicated from its site and there is no further treatment directed to that site and there is no evidence of any existing primary malignancy at that site, a code from category Z85, Personal history of malignant neoplasm, is used to indicate the former site of the malignancy. Look in the Alphabetic Index for History/personal/malignant neoplasm/prostate, leading to Z85.46. Patient had a prostatectomy report Z90.79 Acquired absence of other genital organ(s). Verify all codes in the Tabular List.

### CASE 4 Discharge Diagnoses
#### MRSA sepsis
#### Liver abscess
#### Diabetic ketoacidosis without coma

**Hospital Course:** Melinda Sterling was admitted with epigastric pain. She was admitted initially under the surgical team with suspected gall bladder disease and rectal prolapse. She was then diagnosed with DM II, DKA, MRSA sepsis, and multiple small abscesses on her liver. Zosyn was eventually stopped, and Vancomycin will be continued for a minimum of at least 6 weeks. Her condition continued to improve, and she is now ready for discharge with outpatient follow-up.

**Discharge Medications:** Lantus, Metoprolol, Vancomycin, Amlodipine

**Condition on Discharge:** Home with health services

I had a face-to-face encounter with this patient today. I am referring the patient to home health for IV antibiotic therapy with a diagnosis of MRSA sepsis. The clinical findings of persistent infection requiring IV antibiotics for a minimum of 6 weeks support. The patient demonstrates a considerable and taxing effort when attempting to leave the home.

- I21.3, E11.51, I73.9, I25.119 Z79.4

>**Rationale**: Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Infarct/myocardium/non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) , leading to I21.4. When coding diabetes mellitus, use as many codes from categories E08-E13 as necessary to describe all of the complications and associated conditions of the disease. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, look for Diabetes (type II)/peripheral angiopathy, leading to E11.51. Next, look for Hypertension, leading to I10. The patient has CAD and there is no mention of angina. In the Alphabetic Index under Arteriosclerosis/ coronary you are directed to I25.10. Metformin, a hypoglycemic medication, is used to control the patient’s diabetes. Look for Long-term/oral/hypoglycemic, leading to Z79.84. Verify all codes in the Tabular List.
			
### CASE 6 Discharge Diagnoses
#### Acute respiratory failure w/ hypoxia
#### Emphysema

**Hospital Course:** Sheila Givens is a 54-year-old female with a history of emphysema. The patient stated that her shortness of breath started gradually 5 days ago and has been progressively worsening over time. She described it as moderate to severe with no precipitating ameliorating or aggravating factors. The patient was admitted for acute respiratory failure. She also complained of a dry cough without fever, chills, and diaphoresis In the emergency department she was found to be hypoxic with an oxygen saturation reported to below 85%.

#### What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- J96.00, J43.9
- ==J96.01, J43.9==
- J96.01, J44.9
- J96.91, J43.9

>**Rationale**: When a patient is admitted with respiratory failure and another acute condition (for example, myocardial infarction, aspiration pneumonia, cerebrovascular accident), the principal diagnosis will depend on the individual patient’s situation and what caused the admission of the patient to the hospital. This guideline applies regardless of whether the other acute condition is a respiratory or non-respiratory condition. The physician should be queried for clarification if the documentation is unclear as to which one of the two conditions was the reason for the admission. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, look for Failure/respiratory/acute/with/hypoxia, leading to J96.01. Next, look for Emphysema, leading to J43.9. Verify all codes in the Tabular List.

### Two years post right kidney transplant, a 29-year-old patient is diagnosed with renal carcinoma. What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- C80.2, C64.1
- C80.2, C64.1, , Z94.0
- ==T86.19, C80.2, C64.1==
- T86.19, C80.2, C64.1, Z94.0

>**Rationale**: ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.2.r indicates this situation requires three codes (complication, neoplasm associated with transplant organ, and the malignancy) and is to be coded as a transplant complication. The guideline tells us to assign first the appropriate code from T86.- Complications of transplanted organs, followed by code C80.2 Malignant neoplasm with transplanted organ, then an additional code for the specific malignancy. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Complication/transplant/malignant neoplasm, which directs you to C80.2. In the Tabular List C80.2 has a note to code first the complication code (T86.-) and to use an additional code for the specific malignancy. Carcinoma directs you to primary cancer. Go to the Table of Neoplasms and look for the anatomical site Kidney/renal. Select code C64.- from malignant neoplasm column and verify the code in the Tabular List to determine laterality, referring you to 4 th character 1 for right. If you look to report the status post hepatic transplant, look in the Alphabetic Index for Transplant(ed) status)/kidney Z94.0. However, there is an Excludes1 note which indicates this code is not reported for post-transplant complications so Z94.0 is not reported. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### A 20-year-old male was brought to the ED from his provider’s office. His outside provider manages his major depression, asthma, and epilepsy. During the past week, he became psychotic, hearing voices telling him to kill himself and having intense feelings of worthlessness. During the day, he had an epileptic seizure that could not be controlled by medication. He was admitted for Lithium adjustment. Final diagnoses are: Severe depression with psychotic behavior and epileptic seizure poorly controlled with medication. What ICD-10-CM codes should be reported?

- F33.2, G40.909
- ==F33.3, G40.919==
- F33.3, G43.909, G40.909
- F33.1, G43.919, G40.919

>**Rationale**: Only two final diagnoses are documented: the depression and epilepsy. The asthma is not coded because it was not treated or listed as a final diagnosis. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Depression/major recurrent – see Disorder, depressive, recurrent. Look for Disorder/depressive/major recurrent, referring you to code F33.9. The patient has severe depression and became psychotic. Look for Disorder/depressive/recurrent/current episode/severe/with psychotic features, referring you to code F33.3. Next, in the Alphabetic Index look for Epilepsy, epileptic, epilepsia (attack) (cerebral) (convulsion) (fit) seizure)/intractable, leading to G40.919. The mention of poorly controlled with medication makes the epilepsy intractable.
