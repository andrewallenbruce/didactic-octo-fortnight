## **Quality Measures**
### Which indicator is used to determine rates of urinary tract infections in pediatric patients?
- ==HAC 06==
- NQI 03
- PDI 91
- PDI 18

>**Rationale**: HACs are for hospital acquired conditions. NQI are specifically for neonatal patients. PDI 18 is for urinary tract infection admission rate.

### Which of the following is NOT an HAC?
- Blood incompatibility
- ==Stage II pressure ulcers==
- Iatrogenic pneumothorax with venous catheterization
- Air embolism

>**Rationale**: Categories of HACs
• Foreign object retained after surgery

• Blood incompatibility
• Stage III and IV pressure ulcers
• Falls and trauma
• Manifestations of poor glycemic control
• Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UTI)
• Vascular catheter-associated infection
• Surgical site infection, mediastinitis, following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
• Surgical site infection following bariatric surgery for obesity
• Surgical site infection following certain orthopedic procedures

### HEDIS was created and is maintained by which of the following associations?
- Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
- ==National Committee for Quality Assurance==
- National Committee for Preventable Complications
- The Joint Commission

>**Rationale**: HEDIS was created and is maintained by the National Committee for Quality Assurance.

### A patient is admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure due to asthma exacerbation. This patient was admitted from a nursing home. On day three of the hospital stay, it was documented that the patient had a stage II pressure ulcer. What would the CDEI be required to do for this case?
- ==Code the pressure ulcer based on physician documentation.==
- Query the provider on whether the pressure ulcer was POA.
- Query the nursing home healthcare provider for significance.
- Pressure ulcer will be coded by nursing home.

>**Rationale**: It would be appropriate for the CDEI to query the physician about the pressure ulcer to determine if the patient already had it prior to being admitted and it was not caused by the hospital due to negligence on the medical staff.

### The goals of the Hospital VBP program are all of the following, EXCEPT?
- ==Eliminating or reducing the occurrence of adverse events==
- Adopting evidence-based care standards and protocols that result in the best outcomes for the most patients
- Increasing the transparency of care for consumers
- Recognizing hospitals that are involved in the provision of high-quantity care at higher cost to Medicare

>**Rationale**: Recognizing hospitals that are involved in the provision of high-quantity care at lower cost to Medicare, not higher.

### A patient is admitted to the hospital for new acute myocardial infarction. It is determined that the patient has a chronic total occlusion of the right coronary artery that will require a CABG procedure. The surgery will be done next week at Specialty Hospital and patient will now be transferred. Which is the correct IQI for this case?
- ==IQI 11==
- IQI 12
- IQI 15
- IQI 16

>**Rationale**: The patient has not had the CABG surgery at the time. This will fall under IQI 15 Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) mortality rate

### Which of the following HAC mnemonics represents a surgical site infection following cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs)?
- ==HAC 13==
- HAC 11
- HAC 07
- HAC 03

>**Rationale**: HAC mnemonic HAC 13 represents surgical site infection following cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs).

### Which of the following is an advantage of using Electronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs)?
- ==Ability to create orders in a much faster manner==
- Ability to prepare for increase readmissions
- Assess the quality of treatment by providers
- Allow the focus to be on spending more time documenting

>**Rationale**: The advantages of using eCQMs are
>
• Allow the focus to be on patient care rather than paperwork
• Save time by promoting use of the electronic health record instead of abstracting charts manually
•  Facilitate the use of real-time data to assist in quality improvement and clinical decision making
• Assess the quality of treatment by providers and healthcare organizations
• Assist in reducing costs by identifying measures that can prevent readmission and medication errors

### Which of the following measures is NOT included in the Safety domain of a hospital VBP?
- ==Methicillin-susceptible _Staphylococcus aureus_==
- Catheter-associated urinary tract infection
- _Clostridium difficile_ infection (_c. diff_)
- Surgical site infection - colon surgery; abdominal hysterectomy

>**Rationale**: In the Safety domain the measures include catheter-associated urinary tract infection, _clostridium difficile_ infection ( _c. diff_ ), surgical site infections, and methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_

### Which of the following is not a standardized quality indicator?
- Patient safety indicator
- Pediatric quality indicator
- Neonatal quality indicator
- ==Geriatric qualify indicator==

>**Rationale**: The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has developed three standardized sets of qualify indicators: patient safety indicators, pediatric quality indicators and neonatal quality indicators, and inpatient quality indicators.


### All of the following are part of the four quality metrics established by The Joint Commission, EXCEPT?
- ==Research==
- Readmissions
- Proximity
- Accuracy

>**Rationale**: The four quality metrics established by The Joint Commission are research, proximity, accuracy, and adverse effects.

### A patient is admitted to the hospital for pneumonia. Patient receives antibiotics and will be discharged the next day for further monitoring. The morning of discharge, the patient falls while ambulating to  the restroom. He complaints of hip pain. A CT is ordered and a right hip fracture is found. Which PSI would this fall under?
- ==PSI 02== ??
- PSI 05
- PSI 08
- PSI 90

>**Rationale**: PSI 08 _In hospital fall with hip fracture rate_

### Inpatient quality indicators (IQI) report information on all of the following EXCEPT which of the following?
- Potential overuse
- ==Potential underuse== ??
- Potential usefulness
- Potential misuse

>**Rationale**: Inpatient quality indicators (IQI) report information on inpatient mortality and potential overuse, underuse, or misuse of procedures.

### Which of the following Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) categories is NOT a category from the six readmission categories in which Medicare penalizes hospitals financially?
- ==Chronic kidney disease==
- Acute myocardial infarction
- Pneumonia
- Heart Failure

>**Rationale**: Chronic kidney disease is not a category that falls under the HRRP categories for which Medicare penalizes.

### In the CMS Star Rating Program, which of the following hospitals do NOT calculate an overall rating?
- ==Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospitals==
- Public hospitals
- Private hospitals
- All of the above

>**Rationale**: Overall ratings are not calculated for Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Department of Defense (DoD) hospitals

### Which of the following indicators reports information on potentially avoidable situations or opportunities for improvement in care provided in pediatric patients under 18 years of age?
- ==PSI== ??
- PDI
- HAC
- IQI

>**Rationale**: Pediatric quality indicators (PDI) and neonatal quality indicators (NQI) report information on potentially avoidable situations or opportunities for improvement in care provided in pediatric patients under 18 years of age.

### The Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) program reimburses hospitals based on which of the following?
- ==Accuracy of care== ??
- Quality of care
- Quantity of care
- Planning of care

>**Rationale**: The VBP program rewards acute care hospitals for the quality of care they provide to their patients.

### Which of the following group measures is required for hospitals by the CMS Star Rating Program in order to qualify for an overall star rating?
- Safety of care and readmission
- ==Safety of care and mortality==
- Mortality and readmission
- Readmission and patient experience

>**Rationale**: Eligible hospitals must have at least three measures, with at least one of the groups being mortality or safety of care, to qualify for an overall star rating.

### Which of the following is NOT an HAC category?
- Air embolism
- Catheter-associated urinary tract infection
- ==Total hip arthroplasty==
- Stage III and IV pressure ulcers

>**Rationale**: Categories of HACs include 
>HAC 02 - air embolism
>HAC 04 - Stage III and IV pressure ulcers
>HAC 06 - catheter-associated urinary tract infections
>HAC 10 - deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE) following certain orthopedic procedures 
>includes procedures such as total knee replacements and hip replacements; 
>these, however, are not HAC categories themselves.

### Which of the following is true about exclusions for inpatient quality indicators?
- ==Exclusions apply to all type of inpatient scenarios.== ??
- Exclusions are only limited to transfers and pregnant patients.
- Exclusions apply to pediatric and neonatal patients.
- Exclusions are defined based on hospital policy.

>**Rationale**: Exclusions for IQIs are sometimes limited only to patients who have been transferred from another acute care hospital or patients who are pregnant.

### Which of the following is an advantage of using an eCQM?
- Demonstrates the outcome of evidence-based care
- Increases the transparency of care for consumers
- Increases cost by identifying measures that prevent readmission
- ==Allows the focus to be on patient care rather than paperwork==

>**Rationale**: One of the advantages of eCQMs is allowing the focus to be on patient care rather than paperwork.

### What is the minimum number of measures required by a hospital to qualify for a star rating?
- 1
- ==3==
- 4
- 5

>**Rationale**: Eligible hospitals must report at least three measures to qualify for an overall star rating

### HEDIS measures performance across six domains of care. These six domains consist of all the following, EXCEPT?
- ==Effectiveness of care==
- Access/availability of care
- Experience of care
- Cost of care

>**Rationale**: HEDIS measures performance across six domains of care that are required for reporting effectiveness of care, access/availability of care, experience of care, utilization and risk adjusted utilization, health plan descriptive information, and measure collected using electronic data systems. Cost of care is not one of them.

### Which of the following is NOT a category used in the star rating for a hospital?
- Patient experience
- Timeliness of care
- ==Outcomes==
- All the above

>**Rationale**: The five areas of quality used in star ratings for a hospital include mortality, safety of care, readmission, patient experience, and timeliness.

### The Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) was developed in 2012 by which of the following?
- ==CMS==
- AMA
- OIG
- WHO

>**Rationale**: CMS developed the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) in 2012 as part of the ACA.

### Which of the following measures is captured under the Clinical Outcome domain of a hospital VBP?
- Communication with nurses
- Care transition
- ==Heart failure==
- Surgical site infection

>**Rationale**: The Clinical Outcome Domain includes measures such as heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, total hip arthroplasty, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### The Star Ratings Program summarizes a variety of measures in five different areas. Which of the following requires the less weighted average score?
- ==Mortality== ??
- Safety of care
- Readmission
- Timeliness of care

>**Rationale**: The star ratings summarize a variety of measures in five areas of quality which consist of 
>mortality 22%
>safety of care 22%
>readmission 22%
>patient experience 22%
>and the lowest being timeliness of Care at 12%

### Hospitals are given how many days to review the HRRP results and can dispute if there is clinical evidence to support a diagnosis change?
- ==15==
- 30
- 90
- 120

>**Rationale**: When results are provided from HRRP, hospitals are given 30 days.

### Which is NOT a goal of the Hospital Value Based Purchasing program? 
==Increasing the occurrence of adverse events==
Adopting evidence-based care standards and protocols that result in the best outcomes for the most patient
Increasing the transparency of care for consumers
Recognizing hospitals that are involved in the provision of high-quality care at lower cost to Medicare

>**Rationale**: One of the goals of the VBP program is to eliminate or reduce the occurrence of adverse events or healthcare errors resulting in patient harm.

### Which of the following is NOT a VBP safety measure?
- Catheter-associated urinary tract infections
- Central line-associated blood stream infections 
- MRSA infections
- ==Pressure ulcer infections==

>**Rationale**: The VBP safety domain includes CAUTIs, CLABSIs, MRSA infections, C diff infections, and surgical site infections acquired after admission. These are all quality measures that a CDEI may be able to affect with queries to confirm or rule out diagnoses.

### A patient with osteoporosis was admitted to the hospital with a pathological femur fracture that was repaired with surgery. During the hospital admission, the patient is transferred from the bed to the wheelchair and suffers a traumatic hairline fracture of the 9th rib, which will be coded as POA N. What query would be appropriate for the CDEI to send to try to rule out this HAC?

- A query for severity of the rib fracture
- ==A query for cause and effect between the osteoporosis and the rib fracture==
- If the fracture was present prior to admission
- HACs cannot be ruled out with queries

>**Rationale**: A CDEI could send either a query for clinical significance of the rib fracture, a query to link the osteoporosis and the rib fracture, or both. Because the fracture is hairline, which is relatively minor and should not require additional monitoring, treatment, or resources, it would be appropriate to query the physician for clinical significance to see if the rib fracture should even be coded as a secondary diagnosis. Since the patient has known osteoporosis and already has suffered a pathological fracture due to the osteoporosis, it is logical to presume that the osteoporosis could be the underlying cause of the rib fracture. If that is confirmed by the provider’s query response, then the rib fracture would be coded as a pathological fracture and not a traumatic fracture and would not be a HAC.

### Which would NOT be considered a patient safety indicator (PSI)?
- An enterotomy made in the small intestine during an appendectomy that was repaired during a return to the OR the following day
- Sepsis developing after an elective surgery
- ==Acute kidney injury that did not require dialysis==
- Stage III pressure ulcer that developed 10 days after admission

>**Rationale**: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is only a PSI when it requires dialysis during an elective admission. Because there was no dialysis, this AKI would be excluded as a PSI.

 ### How many days after discharge does the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) track readmissions to calculate their quality metrics?
- ==30 days==
- 60 days
- 90 days
- 120 days

>**Rationale**: The HRRP uses a 30-day discharge model to track patients who are readmitted for acute myocardial infarction, COPD, heart failure, pneumonia, CABG surgery, and elective total hip or knee replacement surgeries. The goal is to have the discharging hospital coordinate with outside caregivers to ensure the patient has continuity of care to prevent a readmission.

 ### Which of the following is true in regard to the Vizient risk model? 
- ==A diagnosis must be present on admission==
- A diagnosis must be an MCC or a CC
- A diagnosis must be a complication
- A diagnosis must be supported by pathology

>**Rationale**: Vizient models require all diagnoses to be present on admission to the inpatient hospital. It is important for a CDEI to look for indicators that a condition may be POA Y if their hospital participates in Vizient models.

### A chest X-ray shows a small apical pneumothorax after the patient had an unrelated procedure. The physician documents postoperative pneumothorax. J95.811 Postprocedural pneumothorax falls into PSI 06. What query would be appropriate to send to the physician to try to exclude this PSI?
1. A query for the meaning of the term postoperative
2. A clinical validation query requiring the provider to show how the pneumothorax was treated, monitored, or increased the length of stay or nursing services
3. A query for the clinical significance of the pneumothorax

- 1
- 2
- 1 and 2
- ==1, 2, and 3==

>**Rationale**: Because the pneumothorax is small and there is no treatment discussed, it is appropriate to send a query for either clinical significance or validation. If the pneumothorax is not clinically significant or does not meet the UHDDS definition of a secondary diagnosis, it should not be coded. A query for the meaning of postoperative would also be appropriate. If the provider’s intended meaning is that the pneumothorax occurred in the postoperative period and is not a complication of the procedure, then it should not be coded as J95.811, but as an unspecified pneumothorax, which is not a PSI.

 ### Which of the following is NOT a VBP domain?
- Communication with doctors
- Communication about medicines
- Cleanliness of hospital environment 
- ==Injuries due to catheter insertion==

>**Rationale**: VBP domains include the following: communication with nurses; communication with doctors; responsiveness of hospital staff; communication about medicines; cleanliness and quietness of hospital environment; discharge information; overall hospital rating; care transition; and catheter-associated urinary tract infection.

### To qualify for an overall star rating, eligible hospitals must have three of the five measure groups including which of the following? 
- Readmission
- Patient safety
- ==Mortality==
- Timeliness of care

>**Rationale**: Eligible hospitals must use three of the five measure groups to quality for an overall star rating, with mortality or safety of care being one of the groups.

### Exclusions from the inpatient safety indicator measure include which of the following?
- Newborn readmissions
- ==Patients transferred from another acute care facility==
- Pediatric patients
- Patients over the age of 65

>**Rationale**: Exclusions for IQIs are sometimes limited only to patients who have been transferred from another acute care hospital or patients who are pregnant. Because there is no way to know what kind of care a patient received at another hospital that may or may not contribute to their death at the current hospital, transferred patients are excluded from the metric. Likewise, pregnancy can cause a host of complications in a patient, which is why it is excluded from most IQIs.
