# Chapter 3
## **Provider Communication**
### Which of the following is NOT a technique to facilitate physician education regarding the CDI process?
- Identify the documentation modifications to be presented to the physicians.
- Make sure the education time works for all parties involved. A brief 15-minute presentation at the monthly department meeting will allow for a larger audience.
- Identify the documentation modifications to be presented to the physicians.
- ==Use a nurse advisor as a resource.== 
       
>**Rationale**: Physician education will only be successful when they are part of the process. This is especially true in relation to CDI and coding. The physicians must be part of the formation, maintenance, improvement, and growth of the program. The following are techniques that will facilitate this process:
>
>Identify the documentation modifications to be presented to the physicians.
>
>Provide information that will motivate the physicians to buy into the process (quality,compliance, mortality).
>
>Make sure the education time works for all parties involved. A brief 15-minute presentation at the monthly department meeting will allow for a larger audience.
>
>Provide case examples with dissimilar outcomes based on coding differences. This not only shows financial impact, but also differences in severity of illness and risk of mortality.
>
>Use a physician advisor as a resource.
	
### If the fee-for-service (FFS) recovery auditor identifies an improper payment, a review results letter is sent to the provider that includes the decision and the rationale for that decision. Which of the following is NOT an option for the provider receiving the letter?
- ==If the provider agrees with the demand letter, they may submit payment.==
- If the provider agrees with the demand letter, they may ask for a [[Overpayment and Recoupment|recoup]] of future payments.
- If the provider disagrees with the demand letter, they may submit a discussion period request to the recovery auditor within 30 days from the date of the demand letter.
- If the provider disagrees with the demand letter, they may submit a rebuttal to the [[Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC)]] (MAC) within 15 days from the date of the demand letter.
    
>**Rationale**: If the FFS recovery auditor identifies an improper payment, a review results letter is sent to the provider that includes the decision and the rationale for that decision. The [[Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC)|MAC]] will adjust the claim and send a demand letter to the provider for the [[Overpayment and Recoupment|overpayment]]. If the provider agrees with the demand letter, they may submit payment; ask for a [[Overpayment and Recoupment|recoup]] of future payments; or ask for an extended payment plan. If the provider disagrees with the demand letter, they may submit a discussion period request to the recovery auditor within 15 days from the date of the demand letter; submit a rebuttal to the [[Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC)|MAC]] within 15 days from the date of the demand letter; or submit a redetermination request to the MAC within 120 days from the date of the demand letter. This last option is the first level of appeal.

### What is NOT an acceptable format for a provider query? 
- Multiple choice
- Non-leading
- Open-ended
- ==Payment based==
    
>**Rationale**: The query should not be constructed in a manner that can be interpreted as leading the physician. Queries can be open and provide documentation from the medical record, along with clinical documentation to obtain and a more concise diagnosis from the physician. Multiple choice or yes/no queries can also be used; however, it is important when providing choices for physicians to include the option of other, or if the diagnosis was uncertain, or could not be determined. Also, queries should not be leading in regard to a specific diagnosis or how it may improve reimbursement.

### Which of the following is an acceptable physician query?
- A query introduces information from another provider’s documentation the provider may not have considered while documenting.
- A query contains a question with three possible answers and the instruction for the provider to choose the best one.
- A query identifies possible differential diagnoses and asks provider for confirmation.
- ==A query states: “Transcriptionist transcribes both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia as a diagnosis. Please clarify.”==
    
>**Rationale**: Because it does not introduce new information not found in the documentation and does not lead the provider to an answer.

### Which of the following would be an appropriate use of an inpatient query?  
1. To improve the [[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]] ® payment
2. To clarify the reason for an order for an echocardiogram
3. To allow the coder to clarify the correct ICD-10-CM code to be reported
4. To clarify if a patient has a manifestation of a chronic illness
5. To keep compliant documentation a priority for the provider
6. To resolve obscure documentation

- 1, 3, and 5
- ==2, 3, 4, 5, and 6==
- 2, 3, 6, and 5
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
    
>**Rationale**: It is inappropriate to query a provider to improve reimbursement. This may be the result of the query, but the goal of a query should always be to sharpen the clinical documentation to improve clinical outcomes. Therefore, I would be incorrect. Queries are written to improve documentation and may be used as educational tools to improve physician documentation. A query is meant to clarify the record so that the correct codes can be abstracted. Clarifying the record may include determining if a causal relationship exists between two conditions, so that the causal relationship can be reported. Queries are also used to resolve conflicting or obscure documentation.

### What is the OIG recommendation regarding non-compliance?
- Take disciplinary action and document the date of the incident, name of the person responsible for taking action, the follow-up action taken, and a list of claims that were affected by the action.
- ==Take disciplinary action and document the date of the incident, name of the reporting party, name of the person responsible for taking action, and the follow-up action taken.==
- Immediately terminate employment for the party found in non-compliance, regardless of the severity of the offense, document the date of the termination, and file a corrected claim on all claims affected.
- Continue to watch the employee in non-compliance until the incidents meet a federal level before taking action.

>**Rationale**: According to the OIG, disciplinary action should be taken based on the severity of the offense. Disciplinary actions could include oral warnings, written reprimands, probation, demotions, termination, etc. The incident should be documented with the date of the incident, name of the reporting party, name of the person responsible for taking action, and the follow-up action taken.

### Civil monetary penalties range from _______ to ________ per violation.    
- $10,000 to $50,000
- ==$11,803 to $23,607==
- $5,587 to $10,677
- $10,677 to $25,541
    
>**Rationale**: CMPs originally ranged from up to $10,000 to $50,000 per violation, depending on the type of violation and the entity. This amount is adjusted annually based on the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act (FCPIA). Current CMPs range from up to $11,803 to $23,607. They may also include an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed for each item or service, or up to three times the amount of remuneration offered, paid, solicited, or received.

### What type of award is a _[[qui tam]]_ relator eligible to receive for bringing a case in which the government intervenes?
- 10-15 percent of the money recovered
- ==15-30 percent of the money recovered==
- 10-15 percent of the total claim amount
- 25-40 percent of the total claim amount
    
>**Rationale**: The above requirements are specified due to the award offered to the relator in a [[qui tam]] action. The relator in an action in which the government intervenes is eligible to receive between 15 and 30 percent of the amount recovered by the government through the [[qui tam]] action. The amount will depend upon the extent to which the relator substantially contributed to the prosecution. Payment to the relator is made from the proceeds received from the defendant.

### Which of the following is the best example of fraudulent activity?
- Waiving cost-shares or deductibles
- A pattern of claims for services not medically necessary
- Failure to maintain adequate medical or financial records
- ==Billing for services at a higher level than provided or necessary==
    
>**Rationale**: [[Fraud]] is an intentional deception or misrepresentation of the fact that can result in unauthorized benefits or payment. In this case, billing for services at a higher level than provided would be considered intentional, and therefore fraudulent.

### What happens when a fee-for-service (FFS) recovery auditor identifies an improper payment?
- A [[Overpayment and Recoupment|recoup]] of payment will be initiated immediately
- ==A review results letter is sent to the provider that includes the decision and the rationale for  that decision==
- A demand letter is initiated
- A rebuttal to the FFS is issued within 15 days of the improper payment  
       
>**Rationale**: If the FFS recovery auditor identifies an improper payment, a review results letter is sent to the provider that includes the decision and the rationale for that decision. The [[Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC)|MAC]] will adjust the claim and send a demand letter to the provider for the [[Overpayment and Recoupment|overpayment]].

### Which publication on the OIG website identifies projects that will be addressed during the fiscal year by the Office of [[Audit]] Services, Office of Evaluation and Inspections, Office of Investigations, and Office of Counsel to the Inspector General?
- ==OIG Work Plan==
- Semiannual Report to Congress
- Compendium of Unimplemented Recommendations
- OIG Compliance Plan Guidance
    
>**Rationale**: The HHS OIG publishes its Work Plan monthly on its website that lists the various projects that will be addressed during the fiscal year by the Office of Audit Services, Office of Evaluation and Inspections, Office of Investigations, and Office of Counsel to the Inspector General. It summarizes new and ongoing reviews and activities that OIG plans to pursue during the next fiscal year and beyond.

### Under the OIG under the Exclusion Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7), what is the minimum term of exclusion that can be applied to a physician banned from participating in any federal or state healthcare program?
- 60 days
- One year
- ==Five years==
- 10 years  

>**Rationale**: According to 42 C.F.R. § 1001.102, the length of exclusion will not be less than five years.

### Which of the following is NOT a benefit of active listening?
- Helping you assess a situation more effectively and accurately
- ==Getting your point across to the listener==
- Allowing the speaker to clarify thoughts and feel heard
- Diffusing emotions that can present large road blocks to thinking effectively
    
>**Rationale**: Active listening has several benefits including: Helping you assess a situation more effectively and accurately, Allowing the speaker to clarify thoughts and feel heard, and Diffusing emotions that can present large road blocks to thinking effectively

### As a CDEI, how can you use the OIG Work Plan to improve documentation?
- ==Review the documentation for services identified on the OIG Work Plan that are performed in your facility and provide feedback regarding documentation deficiencies identified.==
- Review the findings from the OIG Work Plan audit to determine potential revenue opportunities for your facility.
- When presented with a refund request from a private payer, do not allow the refund unless the service is included on the OIG Work Plan.
- Review the quarterly release of the OIG Work Plan.
    
>**Rationale**: Review of the OIG Work Plan provides information on services that will be audited by the OIG. It is a best practice to review the services that appear on the OIG Work Plan that you are performing in the facility.

### OIG compliance guidance indicates that whenever non-compliance is identified by the compliance staff, corrective action must be taken. Which of the following is NOT included in the non-compliant file documentation?
- Date of the incident
- Name of the reporting party
- ==Outcome of the incident==
- Follow-up action taken
    
>**Rationale**: The OIG compliance guidance also indicates that whenever non-compliance is identified by the compliance staff, corrective action must be taken, although there can be varying degrees of disciplinary action. Any finding of non-compliant conduct must be documented in the compliance files and should include:
>
• Date of incident
• Name of the reporting party
• Name of the person responsible for taking action
• The follow-up action taken

### Which of the following is NOT a source of conflict?
- ==Consistent workload==
- Non-specific job role
- Personality conflicts
- Poor management
    
>**Rationale**: Sources of conflict include but are not limited to:
>
• Poor management
• Non-specific job role
• Poor organizational structure
• Weak training or educational requirements
• Personality conflicts
• Increased workload 

### Documentation indicates the patient is “status post hysterectomy.” The patient presents with a fever. Which of the following would be a compliant query to the provider?
- Are the fever and the surgery related?
- What is the patient’s temperature?
- By status post, how long has it been since the patient’s surgery?
- ==Do you know the cause of the fever?==
    
>**Rationale**: CDEIs should not ask leading questions of providers. Instead, ask the question in a way that will generate an original response. By asking if the provider knows the cause of the fever, you will know whether this is a surgical complication.

### A hospital consistently reports a higher MS-DRGs than are supported by the documented to help cover the cost of excessive expenditures. Would this be [[fraud]] or [[abuse]], and why?
- [[Abuse]]; charging a higher level on each visit does not show intent.
- [[Abuse]]; the hospital’s practice is common and therefore would not be considered fraudulent.
- [[Fraud]]; any overcoding of services would be considered fraudulent.
- ==[[Fraud]]; the hospital intentionally overcoded to gain financially.==
    
>**Rationale**: The different between [[fraud]] and [[abuse]] is intent.

### What are some sources of conflict?
- Poor management, decreased workload, weak training or educational requirements
- ==Poor management, personality conflicts, weak training or educational requirements==
- Weak training or educational requirements, increased management, religious preference
- Personality conflicts, cultural conflicts, poor management or specific job roles
    
>**Rationale**: Everyone deals with conflict differently. Some try to be accommodating even if it means sacrificing their own opinions and views. Others outright avoid conflict or become aggressive and uncooperative. Some of us naturally respond to conflict in a responsive but collaborating manner, working to keep all parties’ concerns in mind while reaching an acceptable solution.
>
>**Sources of conflict include but are not limited to:**
>Poor management
>Non-specific job role
>Poor organizational structure
>Weak training or educational requirements
>Personality conflicts
>Increased workload

### What are the two types of reviews performed by fee-for-service (FFS) recovery auditors?
- Automated review and basic review
- Manual review and complex review
- ==Automated review and complex review==
- Manual review and automated review
    
>**Rationale**: The two types of reviews performed by FFS recovery auditors are automated and complex. Automated review — no medical record needed. Automated review occurs when a recovery auditor makes a claim determination at the system level without a human review of the medical record.

### Documentation in the patient’s record indicates the patient has COPD, hypertension, CKD, and is hospitalized with a fever of 39.7 C. The first-listed diagnosis in the discharge summary is ARF. Which query would be most pertinent to coding?
- ==What does the acronym ARF in your documentation represent?==
- Is the CKD acute on chronic?
- Does the patient have benign or malignant hypertension?
- Does the patient have an underlying cause for the CKD?
    
>**Rationale**: This chart cannot be coded until the coder knows the intended meaning of ARF, commonly used to abbreviate acute respiratory failure or acute renal failure. For this patient with COPD, hypertension, and CKD, either meaning might be appropriate. A query is required before coding of this chart can be completed.

### Which of the following defines a _[[qui tam]]_ relator?  
- A person assigned to investigate accusations of fraudulent billing
- ==A person who brings a civil action for a violation for themselves and for the U.S. government==
- The defendant in a _[[qui tam]]_ case
- The employer of the defendant in a _[[qui tam]]_ case
    
>**Rationale**: The FCA states that a person may bring a civil action for a violation for themself and for the United States government. The FCA refers to the person bringing the [[qui tam]] as a relator.

### When a facility is excluded under the Exclusions Statute, what must the entity do at the end of the exclusionary period?
- The provider is automatically reinstated.
- ==The provider must apply for reinstatement.==
- The provider cannot be reinstated once excluded.
- The provider must apply for a group provider number.
    
>**Rationale**: When the exclusionary period has ended, the individual or entity must apply for reinstatement and receive authorized notice from OIG that reinstatement has been granted.

### Please identify which of the following options is NOT a requirement for financial penalties to be mitigated in a federal [[False Claims Act]] case?
- The person committing the violation self discloses within 30 days of knowing about the violation
- The person in violation fully cooperates with the investigation
- No criminal prosecution, civil action, or administrative action has commenced with respect to the violation
- ==The person committing the violation decides to voluntarily opt out of the [[Medicare]] program==
    
>**Rationale**: The FCA allows for reduced penalties (mitigation) if the person committing the violation self-discloses. §3729 a.2 states that the court may assess not less than two times the amount of damages (as opposed to three times), which the government sustains because of the act of that person, if:
>
>(A) the person responsible furnishes officials of the United States responsible for investigating false claims violations with all information known to such person about the violation within 30 days after the date on which the defendant first obtained the information;
>
>(B)    such person fully cooperates with the investigation of such violation; and
>
>(C)    at the time such person furnishes the information about the violation, no criminal prosecution, civil action, or administrative action has commenced under this title with respect to such violation, and the person did not have actual knowledge of the existence of an investigation into such violation.

### What issues might arise due to lack of documentation and/or the ability to achieve physician compliance within the query process?
- Audits, increased reimbursement, quality issues
- Decreased reimbursement, decreased physician salary, quality issues
- Decreased physician salary, quality issues, audits
- ==Quality issues, audits, decreased reimbursement==

>**Rationale**: Lacking documentation and/or the inability to achieve physician compliance within the query process can lead to audits, quality issues, and decreased reimbursement.

### What is the definition of [[abuse]]?
- Making false statements or misrepresenting facts to obtain an undeserved benefit or payment from a federal healthcare program
- ==An action that results in unnecessary costs to a federal healthcare program, either directly or indirectly==
- Reporting the submission of false claims
- Practicing medicine while on the exclusions list of the OIG

>**Rationale**: CMS defines [[fraud]] as making false statements or misrepresenting facts to obtain an undeserved benefit or payment from a federal healthcare program. CMS defines [[abuse]] as an action that results in unnecessary costs to a federal healthcare program, either directly or indirectly.

### The past medical history documents the patient as having had breast cancer and treatment with a unilateral mastectomy two years ago. In the assessment, it is noted that the patient is currently on Tamoxifen. For this encounter, which query is most appropriate?
- Please review this patient’s chart and clarify whether the patient has a resolved or active breast cancer.
- ==Please review the patient’s chart and document the indications for Tamoxifen therapy.==
- Was a reconstruction performed at the time of the mastectomy?
- Please review the documentation and indicate the dosage of the medication.

>**Rationale**: Tamoxifen is used to treat some types of breast cancer in men and women. It is also used to lower a woman's chance of developing breast cancer if she has a high risk (such as a family history of breast cancer).

 ### The three agencies involved in Operation Restore Trust (ORT) are:
- ==The Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Healthcare Financing Administration (HCFA, now CMS), and the Administration on Aging (AoA)==
- The Office of Integral Guidance (OIG), the Healthcare Fraud Administration (HCFA, now CMS), and the Administration on Aging (AoA)
- The Office of Integral Guidance (OIG), the Healthcare Fraud Administration (HCFA now CMS), and the Administration of Health Maintenance (AHM)
- The Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Healthcare Financing Administration (HCFA now CMS), and the Administration of Health Maintenance (AHM)

>**Rationale**: Three agencies were involved in ORT: The Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Healthcare Financing Administration (HCFA, now CMS), and the Administration on Aging (AoA). Based on the successful returns of the pilot program, the AoA increased the grants awarded and expanded the program to every state and U.S. territory. The program is now called Senior Medicare Patrol (SMP). HHS, CMS, and the OIG work with AoA to combat fraud and abuse.

### Which of the following in NOT an example of CMS fraud?
- Making referrals for certain designated services that are prohibited
- Charging excessively for services or supplies
- Failure to maintain adequate medical or financial records
- ==Submitting billing request for approval after the specified timeframe==

>**Rationale**: Submitting a late billing request is not an example of CMS fraud.

### Recovery audit contractors (RACs) review claims on a post-payment basis and use the same CMS regulations that providers are required to follow. Fee-for-service (FFS) recovery auditors contract with CMS to identify Medicare FFS improper payments. Which are the two types of reviews performed by FFS recovery auditors?
- Internal and external
- ==Automated and complex==
- Local and federal
- State and federal

>**Rationale**: The two types of reviews performed by FFS recovery auditors are automated and complex.

### Which of the following is NOT a CMS suggestion for creating a culture of compliance?
- Manage your financial relationships.
- ==Coordinate with other local facilities to maintain consistency.==
- Know your fraud and abuse risk areas.
- Make compliance plan a priority now.

>**Rationale**: CMS states when creating a culture of compliance, “Just because your competitor is doing something doesn’t mean you can or should.”

### The OIG investigates a provider for billing for services that were not rendered. It is determined the provider submitted 27 fraudulent claims, resulting in $139,000 in [[Overpayment and Recoupment|overpayments]] made to the provider. What is the maximum penalty the OIG may seek for fraudulent claims?
- $1,229,451
- $150,000
- $768,451
- ==$1,054,389==

>**Rationale**: Calculation of maximum penalty:
27 claims x $23,607 = $637,389
$139,000 in [[Overpayment and Recoupment|overpayments]] x 3 = $417,000
$637,389 + $417,000= $1,054,389 maximum penalty that can be assessed

### When sending a query to a physician, the query should include all of the following except:
- ==Chief complaint==
- Date query initiated
- Pertinent dates, including date of service for documentation referenced
- Name and contact information of the individual initiating the query

>**Rationale**: The chief complaint is not required in the query criteria.

### Which of the following is not a recognized type of query?
- Open ended
- Verbal
- ==Diabetic==
- Yes or no

>**Rationale**: There are no recognized queries types designated as specifically diabetic.

 ### Regarding query escalation, when a physician does not answer a query, which first response is appropriate?
- The physician should be verbally reprimanded if the query is not completed within 24 hours.
- The CDEI professional should forward the query to the department chair for review when not answered promptly.
- The query is for clarification purposes only and does not have any bearing on the final documentation or coding of the record so it can be ignored.
- ==The CDEI professional should follow the escalation process for their facility as outlined in the policy and procedures.==

>**Rationale**: A clear query escalation process must be established. Each facility must determine their acceptable timeframe for query resolution. 24-48 hours is commonplace. Determine the chain of escalation and involve administration in the process. This process may lead to delinquencies against the practitioner and even suspension of [[Privileging|privileges]].

### Please choose the answer that describes appropriate use of a query.
- ==Medical record terminology does not coincide with ICD-10 terminology==
- Sending a yes/no query for an unestablished diagnosis.
- Sending multiple queries to achieve the desired answer
- Steering the physician to desired documentation or answer

>**Rationale**: Answers B, C, and D are inappropriate reasons to query the physician.

### Which type of query is performed while the patient is still in the hospital?
- Prospective
- Retrospective
- ==Concurrent==
- Concomitant

>**Rationale**: Queries can be done while the patient is still in the hospital. This allows the physician an opportunity to clarify a diagnosis or procedure prior to the patient’s departure. These are called concurrent reviews and queries.

### When communicating with a physician, consider that during indoctrination to medical training and taking the Hippocratic Oath, the primary focus is on ____________.
- Reimbursement
- Resources
- ==The patient==
- Compliance

>**Rationale**: When communicating with a physician, consider that during indoctrination to medical training and the Hippocratic Oath, the primary focus is on the patient.

### Which of the following is generally the best response to conflict?
Being compromising, even at the cost of your feelings
==Acknowledging all parties, including yourself, while actively working to come to a conclusion acceptable to all involved.==
Avoiding conversations or interactions all together
Become uncompromising and aggressive to support your opinion

>**Rationale**: Generally, conflict is more acceptably resolved when parties can acknowledge the thoughts and opinions of all parties involved. This includes your thoughts and opinions. Together, work to a common goal of resolving the conflict.

### Physician education will only be successful when the physician ________
- ==Is part of the process==
- Is required to fulfill education requirements
- Is given optional education
- Requests education

>**Rationale**: Physician education will only be successful when they are part of the process.
