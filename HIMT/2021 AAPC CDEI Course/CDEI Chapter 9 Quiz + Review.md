## Inpatient Procedural Coding and Guidelines

### A patient with acute renal failure is admitted for treatment with dialysis that lasts four hours. What ICD-10-PCS coding is reported?

- 5A1D00Z
- **==5A1D70Z==**
- 5A1D90Z
- 5A1C60Z

>**Rationale**: Renal dialysis codes to the root operation Performance in section 5, the Extracorporeal Assistance and Performance section, for procedures where equipment outside the body is used to assist/perform physiological function. This section has three unique root operations: Assistance, Performance, and Restoration. Performance is defined as completely taking over a physiological function by extracorporeal means. The body system for renal codes to the urinary system. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index for Performance/urinary/intermittent, less than 6 hours per day, and you are directed to complete code 5A1D70Z. The 5th character indicates the series of treatment, intermittent, less than 6 hours per day, and the function is filtration. Locate table 5A1 and go across the row to verify that the code listed in the Alphabetic Index is correct.

- Section (5) Extracorporeal Assistance and Performance
- Body System (A) Physiological Systems
- Operation (1) Performance
- Body System (D) Urinary
- Duration (9) Multiple
- Function (0) Filtration
- Qualifier (Z) No Qualifier

### CT computer-assisted sinus surgery:

- 8E097CZ
- **==8E09XBG==**
- 8E09XBZ
- 8E09XY8

>**Rationale**: This type of CT scan codes to the Other Procedures section. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index for Computer Assisted Procedure/head and neck region/with computerized tomography and you are directed to complete code 8E09XBG. The 6th character indicates the method, which is computer-assisted procedure. The 7th character qualifier indicates it is a CT scan. Locate table 8E0 and go across the row to verify that the code listed in the Alphabetic Index is correct. This code is for the CT assistance only. The CDEI would code the sinus surgery from the surgeon’s operative report.

- Section (8) Other Procedures
- Body System (E) Physiological Systems and Anatomical Regions
- Operation (0) Other Procedures
- Body Region (9) Head and Neck Region
- Approach (X) External
- Method (B) Computer Assisted Procedure
- Qualifier (G) With Computerized Tomography

### CASE 16: Open reduction with internal fixation left femoral shaft fracture
What ICD-10-PCS code?

- **==0QS904Z==**

>**Rationale**: The reduction procedure codes to Reposition.
Look in the Alphabetic Index for Reposition/femoral shaft/left and you are directed to 0QS9. Go to Table 0QS to select the remaining characters. Choose character 0 for Open for the 5th character Approach as the procedure is listed as open. The 6th character 4 indicates an internal fixation device was placed. The 7th character has only one option: character Z. Put the characters together: 0QS904Z.

- Section (0) Medical and Surgical
- Body System (Q) Lower Bones
- Operation (S) Reposition
- Body Part (9) Femoral Shaft, Left
- Approach (0) Open
- Device (4) Internal Fixation Device
- Qualifier (Z) No Qualifier

### Laparotomy for drainage of right lobe liver abscess with placement of drainage device:

- 0F9240Z
- 0F910ZZ
- 0F9200Z
- **==0F9100Z==**

>**Rationale**: The root operation is Drainage and Body System is Hepatobiliary System. Drainage is defined as taking or letting out fluids or gases from a body part. In the question, drain placement is being done to drain liver abscess, so the Root operation Drainage is coded. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index for Drainage/liver/right lobe, referring to 0F91. Go to Table 0F9 to select the remaining characters. Select 0 for Open approach for the 5 th character, since this procedure involves drain placement through laparotomy (incision into the abdominal wall to access abdominal cavity). Select 0 for the 6th character for Drainage Device. When a drainage procedure includes putting in a catheter, the sixth character of the code is the device value “drainage device.” Select Z for 7th character. Put all the characters together: 0F9100Z.

- Section (0) Medical and Surgical
- Body System (F) Hepatobiliary System and Pancreas
- Operation (9) Drainage
- Body Part (1) Liver, Right Lobe
- Approach (0) Open
- Device (0) Drainage Device
- Qualifier (Z) No Qualifier

### Removal of left failed kidney, open:

- 0TT00ZZ
- **==0TT10ZZ==**
- 0TB10ZZ
- 0TB10ZX

>**Rationale**: Explantation of kidney is coded to root operation Resection since complete kidney is removed. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index for Resection/kidney/left and you are directed to 0TT1. Go to Table 0TT to select the remaining characters. Choose character 0 for Open for the 5th character Approach as the procedure is listed as open. The 6th and 7th characters have only one option: character Z. Put all the characters together: 0TT10ZZ.

- Section (0) Medical and Surgical
- Body System (T) Urinary System
- Operation (T) Resection
- Body Part (1) Kidney, Left
- Approach (0) Open
- Device (Z) No Device
- Qualifier (Z) No Qualifier

### Bili-lite phototherapy, series treatment:

- **==6A601ZZ==**
- 6A651ZZ
- 6A601ZZ
- 6A800ZZ

>**Rationale**: Phototherapy codes to the extracorporeal therapies section. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index for Bili-light therapy and you are directed to see Phototherapy/skin 6A60. Go to Table 6A6 to select the remaining characters. Select the 5th character 1 for multiple since this is a series of treatments. This therapy is often done in cases of newborn jaundice. The 6 th and 7th characters have only one option, character Z. Put all the characters together: 6A601ZZ. CAUTION: Do not assign UV (ultraviolet) light therapy for Bili Light. UV light is only a small spectrum of light rays. Phototherapy involves the full spectrum of light rays. 

- Section(6) Extracorporeal or Systemic Therapies
- Body System (A) Physiological Systems
- Operation (6) Phototherapy
- Body System (0) Skin
- Duration (1) Multiple
- Qualifier (Z) No Qualifier
- Qualifier (Z) No Qualifier

### What are the first four PCS characters assigned when coding a removal of a dual chamber cardiac pacemaker pulse generator located in the chest wall?

- 02PA
- 0JWT
- **==0JPT==**
- 0JH6

>**Rationale**: 0JPT are the first four characters when assigning the PCS code for the removal of a dual chamber pacemaker generator. Look up the main term “Removal of device from” in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index. Next, locate the subterm subcutaneous tissue, trunk. During the insertion procedure, the pulse generator is placed in the subcutaneous tissue of the chest, which is why we go to the subterm subcutaneous in the Alphabetic Index. This will lead you to the 0JPT table.

### All codes in ICD-10-PCS have how many characters?

- 6
- **==7==**
- 8
- 3

>**Rationale**: All codes in ICD-10-PCS are seven characters long.

### Right partial mastectomy, open:

- 0HTT0ZZ
- **==0HBT0ZZ==**
- 0HBU0ZZ
- 0HBT0ZX

>**Rationale**: The root operation for partial mastectomy is Excision. Since only the partial breast is removed, the root operation is excision, not resection. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index for Excision/breast/right and you are directed to 0HBT. Go to Table 0HB to select the remaining characters. Choose character 0 for Open for the 5th character approach as the procedure is listed as open. The 6 th character has only one option: character Z. For the 7th character, select Z for No Qualifier since no biopsy was taken and character X for Diagnostic does NOT apply. Put all the characters together: 0HBT0ZZ.

- Section (0) Medical and Surgical
- Body System (H) Skin and Breast
- Operation (B) Excision
- Body Part (T) Breast, Right
- Approach (0) Open
- Device (Z) No Device
- Qualifier (Z) No Qualifier

### Mitral valvulotomy for release of fused leaflets, open:

- 02QG0ZZ
- 02QG3ZZ
- **==02NG0ZZ==**
- 02NG3ZZ

>**Rationale**: The root operation is Release and Body System is Heart and Great Vessels. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Index for Release/valve/mitral, referring to 02NG. Go to Table 02N to select the remaining characters. The question says the approach was open, so choose 0 for 5 th character. The 6th and 7th characters have only one option, character Z. Put all the characters together: 02NG0ZZ.

- Section (0) Medical and Surgical
- Body System (2) Heart and Great Vessels
- Operation (N) Release
- Body Part (G) Mitral Valve
- Approach (0) Open
- Device (Z) No Device
- Qualifier (Z) No Qualifier

### Percutaneous needle core biopsy of right kidney:

- **==0TB03ZX==**
- 0TB03ZZ
- 0TB04ZX
- 0TB04ZZ

>**Rationale**: Biopsy is coded to root operation Excision with qualifier Diagnostic. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index for Excision/kidney/right and you are directed to 0TB0. Go to Table 0TB to select the remaining characters. Select 3 for percutaneous approach for 5 th character since a needle biopsy was performed. The 6th character has only one option: Z. The 7th character X for Diagnostic indicates that the procedure is a biopsy. Put all the characters together: 0TB03ZX.

- Section (0) Medical and Surgical
- Body System (T) Urinary System
- Operation (B) Excision
- Body Part (0) Kidney, Right
- Approach (3) Percutaneous
- Device (Z) No Device
- Qualifier (X) Diagnostic

### A patient with suspected carcinoma of the colon was taken for an exploratory laparotomy. During the procedure, a significant mass was discovered in the sigmoid colon. A mass was noted in the liver, and a biopsy of the sigmoid colon and liver was performed during the procedure. The pathology report confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon and metastatic carcinoma of the liver. Which ICD-10-PCS coding is reported?

- 0FB03ZX
- 0WJG0ZZ, 0FB03ZX
- **==0DBN0ZX, 0FB00ZX==**
- 0WJG3ZZ

>**Rationale**: Two procedure codes need to be reported: one for the biopsy of sigmoid colon and another for biopsy of liver. CAUTION: Exploratory laparotomy will NOT be coded separately here. As per ICD-10-PCS guideline B3.11c, when both an Inspection procedure and another procedure are performed on the same body part during the same episode, if the Inspection procedure is performed using a different approach than the other procedure, the Inspection procedure is coded separately. Since Biopsy and Inspection (exploratory laparotomy) both are being done through open approach, only the Biopsy procedures will be reported. The biopsy codes to the root operation Excision. The sigmoid colon is a part of Gastrointestinal system and liver is a part of the hepatobiliary system. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Index for Excision/colon/sigmoid, referring to 0DBN. Go to Table 0DB to select the remaining characters. Select 0 for Open approach for the 5 th character. Select Z for No Device for the 6th character. The 7th character is “X” to indicate a biopsy. Put all the characters together: 0DBN0ZX. Similarly, the code for biopsy of liver can be selected.

- Biopsy of sigmoid colon: 0DBN0ZX
- Section (0) Medical and Surgical
- Body System (D) Gastrointestinal System
- Operation (B) Excision
- Body Part (N) Sigmoid Colon
- Approach (0) Open
- Device (Z) No Device
- Qualifier (X) Diagnostic

### Laparotomy with drain placement for liver abscess, right lobe:

- **==0F9100Z==**
- 0F910ZZ
- 0F9240Z
- 0F9200Z

>**Rationale**: The root operation is Drainage and body system is Hepatobiliary System. Drainage is defined as taking or letting out fluids or gases from a body part. In the question, drain placement is being done to drain liver abscess, so the root operation Drainage is coded.
Look in the ICD-10-PCS Index for Drainage/liver/right lobe, referring to 0F91. Go to Table 0F9 to select the remaining characters. Select 0 for Open approach for 5th character since procedure involves drain placement through laparotomy (incision into the abdominal wall to access abdominal cavity). Select 0 for 6th character for Drainage Device. When a drainage procedure includes putting in a catheter, the sixth character of the code is the device value “drainage device.” Select Z for 7th character. Put all the characters together: 0F9100Z.

- Code 0F9100Z
- Section (0) Medical and Surgical
- Body System (F) Hepatobiliary System and Pancreas
- Operation (9) Drainage
- Body Part (1) Liver, Right Lobe
- Approach (0) Open
- Device (0) Drainage Device
- Qualifier (Z) No Qualifier

### A physician performs a laparoscopic destruction of the bilateral ovaries.

- 0UB24ZZ
- **==0U524ZZ==**
- 0U9240Z
- 0U504ZZ, 0U514ZZ

>**Rationale**: The root operation is Destruction.
Look in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index for Destruction/ovary/bilateral and you are directed to 0U52. Go to Table 0U5 to select the remaining characters. The approach is percutaneous endoscopic, so select 4 for character 5. The 6th and 7th characters have only one option: character Z. Put all the characters together: 0U524ZZ. Answer B is not correct because there is a bilateral body part. Per ICD-10-PCS guideline B4.3, if a bilateral body part value is available, a single procedure is coded with the bilateral body part value instead of two procedures using separate body part values.

- Section (0) Medical and Surgical
- Body System (U) Female Reproductive System
- Operation (5) Destruction
- Body Part (2) Ovaries, Bilateral
- Approach (4) Percutaneous Endoscopic
- Device (Z) No Device
- Qualifier (Z) No Qualifier

### An inpatient undergoes wound care treatment of a left calf ulcer down to the muscle with pulsatile lavage.

- F08L5CZ
- F08K5BZ
- **==F08L5BZ==**
- F08G5ZZ

>**Rationale**: Wound care codes to the Physical Rehabilitation and Diagnostic Audiology section. All the Physical Rehabilitation and Diagnostic Audiology root types include type qualifiers to further specify the procedure type. For example, activities of daily living treatment includes type qualifiers such as wound management, bathing/showering techniques, dressing techniques, and feeding/eating activities. Activities of Daily Living Treatment is defined as exercise or activities to facilitate functional competence for activities of daily living. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index for Activities of Daily Living Treatment and you are directed to F08. Go to Table F08 to select the remaining characters. The 4 th character L indicates Musculoskeletal System-Lower Extremity. This was a calf ulcer down to muscle tissue and is, therefore, deeper than the Integumentary System. The qualifier 5th character is wound management and the 6th character is equipment, which is physical agents indicating the pulsatile lavage. The 7th character has only one option, character Z. Put all the characters together: F08L5BZ.

- Section (F) Physical Rehabilitation and Diagnostic Audiology
- Section Qualifier (0) Rehabilitation
- Type (8) Activities of Daily Living Treatment
- Body System / Region (L) Musculoskeletal System - Lower Back / Lower Extremity
- Type Qualifier (5) Wound Management
- Equipment (B) Physical Agents
- Qualifier (Z) None

### When an inspection and another root operation are performed on the same body part during the same operative session, both the inspection and the root operative procedure are coded when?

- An inspection is performed prior to the root operation
- The inspection is performed to check the placement of a device placed during the root operation using a different approach
- **==The inspection procedure is performed using a different approach than the root operation==**
- None of the above

>**Rationale**: ICD-10-PCS guideline B3.11c states that when both an Inspection procedure and another procedure are performed on the same body part during the same episode, if the Inspection procedure is performed using a different approach than the other procedure, the Inspection procedure is coded separately.

### An inpatient is taken to the Nuclear Medicine department for an Adenosine sestamibi technetium planar scan of heart muscle at rest.

- C23GYZZ
- C21GZZZ
- C22G1ZZ
- **==C21G1ZZ==**

>**Rationale**: The nuclear medicine tests code to the nuclear medicine section. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index for Nuclear Medicine and you must select the type of test performed. Since a planar scan of heart muscle (myocardium) is done, look for Planar Nuclear Medicine Imaging/myocardium and you are directed to C21G. Go to Table C21 to select the remaining characters. The 5th character 1 for radionuclide indicates the technetium. The 6th and 7th characters have only one option, character Z. Put all the characters together for C21G1ZZ.

- Section (C) Nuclear Medicine
- Body System (2) Heart
- Type (1) Planar Nuclear Medicine
- Body Part (G) Myocardium
- Radionuclide (1) Technetium 99m (Tc-99m)
- Qualifier (Z) None
- Qualifier (Z) None

### Chemical pleurodesis using injection of tetracycline for destruction:

- 3E0L3HZ
- **==3E0L3GC==**
- 0BNM4ZZ
- 0B5M3ZZ

>**Rationale**: A chemical pleurodesis codes to Administration, unlike mechanical pleurodesis, which codes to Excision. The body system is the pleural cavity and the approach is percutaneous because the chemical is administered by injection through layers of skin until it reaches the pleural cavity. The 6 th character, Substance (character G), indicates that a therapeutic substance is administered to create adhesions, which is the purpose of the pleurodesis. Character 9, Anti-infective, is not correct because the tetracycline is not being used for the purpose of fighting an infection. Character T, Destructive agent, is not correct because a pleurodesis does not destroy the pleural cavity. The AHA Coding Clinic volume 2, Number 2, Quarter 2, 2015 says that in a chemical pleurodesis, the root operation Destruction is not appropriate because the pleura itself is not being destroyed. Since the root operation Destruction is not appropriate, then the substance destructive agent is not appropriate either. The Coding Clinic instructs the coder to use character G, Other Therapeutic Substance. For the 7th character, there is only one choice when you follow the line across in the ICD-10-PCS table 3EO: character C, Other Substance. Remember, do not cross the lines when building codes from the tables.

- Section (3) Administration
- Body System (E) Physiological Systems and Anatomical Regions
- Operation (0) Introduction
- Body System / Region (L) Pleural Cavity
- Approach (3) Percutaneous
- Substance (G) Other Therapeutic Substance
- Qualifier (Z) Other Substance

### CASE 12: A patient underwent left total mastectomy
What ICD-10-PCS Code?

- **==0HTU0ZZ==**

>**Rationale**: A mastectomy is complete removal of the breast. This codes to the root operation Resection. Resection is cutting out or off all of a body part. Excision is cutting out of off only a portion of a body part. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Resection/breast/left and you are directed to complete code 0HTU0ZZ. Go to Table 0HT and verify the code.

- Section (0) Medical and Surgical
- Body System (H) Skin and Breast
- Operation (T) Resection
- Body Part (U) Breast, Left
- Approach (0) Open
- Device (Z) No Device
- Qualifier (Z) No Qualifier

### CASE 4: Right heart catheterization with Swan-Ganz catheter placement in the right pulmonary artery for cardiac pressure assessment
What ICD-10-PCS Code?

- **==02HQ32Z==**

>**Rationale**: The correct response is 02HQ32Z. Since the procedure is performed to assess cardiac pressure and there is no mention of a right heart catheter diagnostic procedure at this time, do not code for a right heart catheterization procedure. Swan-Ganz catheterization represents an Insertion root operation for the 3rd character. In the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index, look for Insertion of device in/artery/pulmonary/right, referring to 02HQ. Go to Table 02H to select the remaining characters. The Approach, character 5, for a Swan-Ganz catheter is Percutaneous, 3, as the catheter is inserted through an incision in the groin or neck with the catheter moved up into position in the heart. The 6th character, Device, is coded as 2 Monitoring Device, according to Coding Clinic, Vol. 2, Number 3, Quarter 3, 2015. The 7th character has only one choice: Z. Put all the characters together: 02HQ32Z.

- Section (0) Medical and Surgical
- Body System (2) Heart and Great Vessels
- Operation (H) Insertion
- Body Part (Q) Pulmonary Artery, Right
- Approach (3) Percutaneous
- Device (2) Monitoring Device
- Qualifier (Z) No Qualifier

### A critical care patient is receiving continuous venous arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

- 5A1955Z
- **==5A1522G==**
- 5A1223Z
- 5A12012

>**Rationale**: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is found in the Extracorporeal Assistance and Performance section. ECMO is used when a patient’s heart and lungs are not able to provide adequate gas exchange. During ECMO, blood is removed from a person’s body and the carbon dioxide is artificially removed, then the blood is oxygenated and returned. This is an intensive care procedure done on critical patients. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index for ECMO and you are directed to see Performance/circulatory. Go to main term Performance/circulatory/continuous/peripheral veno-arterial membrane, and you are directed to complete code 5A1522G. Locate table 5A1 and go across the row to verify that the code listed in the Alphabetic Index is correct.

- Section (5) Extracorporeal Assistance and Performance
- Body System (A) Physiological Systems
- Operation (1) Performance
- Body System (5) Circulatory
- Duration (2) Continuous
- Function (2) Oxygenation
- Qualifier (G) Membrane, Peripheral Veno-arterial

### CASE 14: A physician performs an open fasciocutaneous flap closure of the left thigh
What ICD-10-PCS Code?

- **==0JXM0ZC==**

>**Rationale**: The root operation for a flap procedure is Transfer. In transfer procedures the body part remains connected to its vascular and nervous supply. The body system value describes the deepest tissue layer in the flap. The qualifier can be used to describe the other tissue layers when more than one tissue layer is transferred. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Transfer/subcutaneous tissue and fascia/upper leg/left and you are directed to 0JXM. Go to Table 0JX to select the remaining characters. Choose character 0 for Open for the 5th character Approach as the procedure is listed as open. The 6th character has only one option: Z for No device. The 7th qualifier C indicates that the flap is of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia. Put the characters together: 0JXM0ZC.

- Section (0) Medical and Surgical
- Body System (J) Subcutaneous Tissue and Fascia
- Operation (X) Transfer
- Body Part (M) Subcutaneous Tissue and Fascia, Left Upper Leg
- Approach (0) Open
- Device (Z) No Device
- Qualifier (C) Skin, Subcutaneous Tissue and Fascia

### CASE 7: Open bilateral radical lymphadenectomy of iliac lymph nodes, removal of the entire lymphatic chain
What ICD-10-PCS Code?

- **==07TC0ZZ==**

>**Rationale**: The correct response is 07TC0ZZ. The correct root operation is Resection because the lymphadenectomy was noted to be radical, which is removal of the entire chain of lymph nodes and the surrounding tissue, so it meets the definition for a resection. Resection is the removal of ALL of a body part. Body part is Lymphatic, Pelvis as the iliac lymph nodes are located in the pelvic region. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index for Resection/lymphatic/pelvis, referring to 07TC. Go to Table 07T to select the remaining characters. Select 0 for the 5th character since the procedure is listed as open. The 6th and 7th characters have only one option: character Z. Put the characters together: 07TC0ZZ.

- Section (0) Medical and Surgical
- Body System (7) Lymphatic and Hemic Systems
- Operation (T) Resection
- Body Part (C) Lymphatic, Pelvis
- Approach (0) Open
- Device (Z) No Device
- Qualifier (Z) No Qualifier

### CABG of LAD using left internal mammary artery, open, off-bypass:

- 02100J9
- **==02100Z9==**
- 02100AW
- 02100A9

>**Rationale**: The root operation is Bypass and the body system is Heart and Great Vessels. Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is a procedure used to treat coronary artery disease (CAD). For coronary artery bypass procedures, the body part identifies the number of coronary arteries sites bypassed to, and the qualifier specifies the vessel bypassed from. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index for Bypass/artery/coronary/one artery, referring to 0210. Go to Table 021 to select the remaining characters. The question says the approach was open, so choose 0 for the 5 th character. Select Z for No Device for 6th character. Note that when the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) is used to perform the bypass, no device value is assigned because the internal mammary artery is not disconnected from its blood supply, i.e., not a free graft that is excised and moved (rather, it remains connected and is sutured to the bypass location). Select 9 for Internal Mammary, Left for 7th character. Put all the characters together: 02100Z9.

- Section (0) Medical and Surgical
- Body System (2) Heart and Great Vessels
- Operation (1) Bypass
- Body Part (0) Coronary Artery, One Artery
- Approach (0) Open
- Device (Z) No Device
- Qualifier (9) Internal Mammary, Left

### CASE 3: Open placement of single chamber rate responsive pacemaker into the subcutaneous tissue of the chest wall
What ICD-10-PCS Code?

- **==0JH605Z==**

>**Rationale**: The correct response is 0JH605Z. The root operation is Insertion. The body system is Subcutaneous Tissue and Fascia because the pacemaker is placed in a pocket in the chest wall. In the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index, look for Insertion of device in/subcutaneous tissue and fascia/chest, referring to 0JH6. Go to Table 0JH to select remaining characters. The 6th character 5 indicates the device, pacemaker, single chamber rate responsive. Character Z is the only choice for the 7th character.

- Section (0) Medical and Surgical
- Body System (J) Subcutaneous Tissue and Fascia
- Operation (H) Insertion
- Body Part (6) Subcutaneous Tissue and Fascia, Chest
- Approach (0) Open
- Device (5) Pacemaker, Single Chamber Rate Responsive
- Qualifier (Z) No Qualifier

### Patient is being seen today for a partial nephrectomy. The abdomen is insufflated, the trocars are inserted, and the peritoneal cavity is examined. The kidney is visualized, and a lesion is seen superficially. The renal hilum is clamped, a resection of the lesion is performed and sent to pathology. The area is cauterized and the procedure is finalized. What is the correct root operation for this procedure?

- **==Excision==**
- Resection
- Division
- Inspection

>**Rationale**: The patient had a partial nephrectomy, in which the intent was to remove part of the kidney and not all of it. The root operation excision is “cutting out or off, without replacement, a portion of a body part.” which makes A the correct answer. Resection is removing all of a body part, which is not done in this case. Division is used when the purpose of the procedure is to cut into a body part without draining fluids or gases to separate an area. Inspection is used for exploring purposes only.

 ### Patient is taken to operating room for biopsy of a suspicious lesion in the liver and excision of the sigmoid colon due to necrotic lesions. As per ICD-10-PCS coding guidelines, which of the following is TRUE?

- Code both procedures and use the qualifier for “diagnostic.”
- Code only the definitive procedure of the sigmoid colon excision.
- **==Code both procedures as they have distinct objectives on different body parts.==**
- Code only the definitive procedure of the biopsy of the liver.

>**Rationale**: As per ICD-10-PCS coding guideline B3.2a the same root operation is performed on different body parts as defined by distinct values of the body part character.

### Patient is having a PICC line placed under interventional radiology. The patient was identified and placed in the supine position. The right arm was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Under ultrasound guidance, the right basilic vein was punctured. An 0.018 in wire was introduced, the needle removed, and a 5.5 French sheath placed. Under fluoroscopic observation and via the peel-away sheath, a 2 cm 5 French double lumen PICC line was placed with its tip at the junction of the distal superior vena cava. The catheter was flushed with heparinized saline and sutured to the patient’s skin. The patient tolerated the procedure well. What is the correct ICD-10-PCS code?

- 02HV32Z
- 02HV03Z
- 02HP33Z
- **==02HV33Z==**

>**Rationale**: The placement of a PICC line is done for infusion purposes by percutaneous approach. When selecting the proper body part in the ICD-10-PCS table, select the body part where the catheter tip resides, which in this case was at the superior vena cava. Answer A is incorrect as the device character selected was monitoring device and should be infusion. Answer B is incorrect as the approach should be percutaneous and not open, due to the use of a catheter and puncture approach. Answer C is incorrect as the body part value shows pulmonary trunk but the procedure states the tip resides at the superior vena cava. This will make the correct answer D.

### Patient diagnosed with moderate malnutrition needs to have a PEG tube placed for TPN. After informed consent, the patient is taken to the endoscopy suite. An EGD is performed to examine the stomach and identify the area of PEG tube placement. Then attention is placed in the abdomen, a skin incision is made, a needle and sheath are inserted as well as a guidewire. The PEG is secured to the guidewire and the tube is placed in the stomach. Final images are taken and the PEG tube is placed appropriately. What is the correct ICD-10-PCS code?

- **==0DH63UZ==**
- 0DH53UZ
- 0DH68UZ
- 0DP63UZ

>**Rationale**: A PEG tube is placed through the abdominal skin into the stomach. The use of EGD is an integral procedure for guidance to ensure the PEG tube is placed in the right area making answer A the correct answer. This is further supported by AHA Coding Clinic Vol 30 No. 4 2013. Answer B is incorrect as the body part value selected is esophagus, but the PEG device was placed in the stomach. Answer C is incorrect based on the approach; a PEG tube procedure is coded to percutaneous and it includes any type of endoscopic assistance (EGD). Answer D is incorrect as the root operation of the procedure is removal for this code, when it should be insertion as the intent of the procedure is to insert a PEG tube.

### Patient is found to have a lesion on the scalp. A decision is made to excise the lesion completely. An elliptical incision is made overlying the lesion. This was carefully taken down to and into the level of the fascia. Flaps were raised using sharp dissection. The mass is completely excised, the wound is copiously irrigated, and electrocautery is used to obtain hemostasis. The wound is closed in layers using sutures. No complications are reported.

What is the correct ICD-10-PCS code?

- **==0JB00ZZ==**
- 0NB00ZZ
- 0JB03ZZ
- 0HB0XZZ

>**Rationale**: The patient required a lesion to be removed from the scalp by excising it all the way down to the fascia. The sharp dissection and anatomical part define the procedure as an open approach procedure. Answer A is correct as it specifies the excision being done in the fascia via an open approach. Answer B is incorrect as the code is for excision of skull, meaning the bone. Answer C is incorrect as the approach is coded as percutaneous which is incorrect. Answer D is incorrect as the body part has to be specified as subcutaneous tissue and fascia and not skin; also the approach is not external.

### What is the ICD-10-PCS code(s) for an excision of malignant melanoma from the skin of the left hand and right upper arm?

- 0HBFXZZ, 0HBEEXZZ

>**Rationale**: See coding guideline B3.2.a, Multiple Procedures. During the same operative episode, multiple procedures are coded if the same root operation is performed on different body parts as defined by distinct values of the body part character.

### What is the ICD-10-PCS code for an open resection of ascending colon?

- **==0DTK0ZZ==**
- 0DTM0ZZ
- 0DT54ZZ
- 0DTM4ZZ

>**Rationale**: In this case, Resection is used because the entire ascending colon was resected. If a portion was removed, Excision would be coded.

### What is the ICD-10-PCS code(s) for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy converted to complete cholecystectomy?

- 0FT40ZZ
- 0FJ44ZZ
- **==0FT40ZZ, 0FJ44ZZ==**
- 0FT40ZZ, 8E0W0CZ

>**Rationale**: In this case, a laparoscopic procedure was attempted, but was converted to an open procedure. See coding guideline B3.2.d. During the same operative episode, multiple procedures are coded if the intended root operation is attempted using one approach but is converted to a different approach.

### The patient was admitted for chemotherapy for breast cancer. He received Taxol and Cisplatin percutaneously via central vein IV without difficulty. He was to return in four weeks for his next treatment. What is the ICD-10-PCS code for the patient’s treatment?

>**Rationale**: A lumbar puncture is performed using a needle to withdraw cerebrospinal fluid from the spinal canal. The seventh character of X indicates that this is a diagnostic procedure.

### A patient receives mechanical ventilation for 16 hours:

- 5A1945Z
- 5A19054
- **==5A1935Z==**
- 5A1955Z

>**Rationale**: Mechanical ventilation codes to the Extracorporeal Assistance and Performance section and the respiratory body system. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index for Mechanical Ventilation and you are directed to see Performance, Respiratory. Go to main term Performance/respiratory/less than 24 consecutive hours, ventilation, and you are directed to complete code 5A1935Z. The 5th character indicates the duration and is important, as the duration often impacts the DRG assignment for respiratory DRGs. Locate table 5A1 and go across the row to verify that the code listed in the Alphabetic Index is correct.

### A physician performs a vaginal dilation and curettage (D & C) of a patient’s endometrium.

- 0UB98ZX
- **==0UDB7ZZ==**
- 0UC97ZZ
- 0UDB8ZZ

>**Rationale**: The root operation for the D & C procedure is Extraction. Extraction is defined as pulling or stripping out or off all or a portion of a body part using force. Examples of extraction are dilation and curettage, vein stripping, suction dilation and curettage, and phacoemulsification without intraocular lens implant. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Extraction/endometrium and you are directed to 0UDB. Go to Table 0UD to select the remaining characters. The approach is via a natural or artificial opening because the procedure was done via the vagina, so select 7 for the 5th character Approach. Select Z for the 6th and 7th characters. Put all the characters together: 0UDB7ZZ.

### CASE 11: A physician performs an open left hemithyroidectomy

- **==0GTG0ZZ==**

>**Rationale**: A left hemithyroidectomy is complete removal of the left thyroid gland lobe. This codes to Resection as the root operation. The thyroid is part of the endocrine system. The definition of resection is cutting out or off all of a body part. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Resection/thyroid gland/left lobe, which directs to 0GTG. Go to Table 0GT to select the remaining characters. Choose character 0 for Open for the 5th character, Approach, as the procedure is listed as open. The 6th and 7th characters have only one option: character Z. Put all of the characters together: 0GTG0ZZ.

### CASE 15: A physician performs an open fracture reduction of a patient’s right tibia

- **==0QSG0ZZ==**

>**Rationale**: The reduction codes to the root operation Reposition. The tibia is part of the Lower Bones. Reposition represents procedures for moving a body part to a new location. The range of reposition procedures includes moving a body part to its normal location or moving a body part to a new location to enhance its ability to function. Examples of reposition procedures include reduction of fractures, reposition of undescended testicle, transposition of a nerve, and repositioning of a ligament. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Reposition/tibia/right and you are directed to 0QSG. Go to Table 0QS to select the remaining characters. Choose character 0 for Open for the 5th character Approach as the procedure is listed as open. Choose character Z for No Device since there is no documentation of any internal/external fixation device being used. The 7th character has only one option: character Z. Put the characters together: 0QSG0ZZ.

- Section (0) Medical and Surgical

### A physician performs an extraperitoneal C-section, low transverse incision:

- **==10D00Z2==**
- 10D07Z4
- 10D07Z3
- 10D00Z1

>**Rationale**: A C-section codes to root operation Extraction of products of conception. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index for Cesarean section, which guides you to see Extraction/products of conception. Go to the main term Extraction/products of conception/extraperitoneal and you are directed to complete code 10D00Z2. The 7th character qualifier 2 indicates the procedure is extraperitoneal. This is used when the approach is outside of the peritoneal cavity, i.e., an abdominal incision. Go to Table 10D to verify the code.

- Section (1) Obstetrics
- Body System (0) Pregnancy
- Operation (D) Extraction
- Body Part (0) Products of Conception

### Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL), bilateral ureters:

- 0TF63ZZ,0TF73ZZ
- **==0TF6XZZ, 0TF7XZZ==**
- 0TC67ZZ, 0TC77ZZ
- 0TC63ZZ, 0TC73ZZ

>**Rationale**: The root operation for ESWL is Fragmentation. Fragmentation is defined as the breaking apart of solid matter in a body part. An important distinction of a fragmentation from extirpation procedure is that the solid matter is fragmented but not removed from the body. Instead, the pieces of the solid matter are either eliminated or absorbed through normal biological functions. For the ESWL, none of the stone is removed, so root operation extirpation does NOT apply. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Fragmentation/ureter/right and you are directed to 0TF6. Two separate codes are required for left and right ureters as there is not a bilateral body part value for the ureter. Go to Table 0TF to select the remaining characters. Select character X for External Approach since procedure is extracorporeal. The 6th and 7th characters have only one option: character Z. Put the characters together: 0TF6XZZ, 0TF7XZZ.

### Right common carotid endarterectomy, open:

- 04CH0ZZ
- 03CJ0ZZ
- **==03CH0ZZ==**
- 03CH3ZZ

>**Rationale**: The root operation is Extirpation and body system is Upper Arteries. Extirpation represents a range of procedures where the body part itself is not the focus of the procedure. Instead, the objective is to remove solid material, such as a foreign body, thrombus, or calculus, from the body part. An endarterectomy surgically removes atherosclerotic material built up on the inside of the common carotid artery narrowing the vessel. Examples of an extirpation procedure include thrombectomy, endarterectomy, choledocholithotomy, and excision of a foreign body. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Index for Extirpation/common carotid/right, referring to 03CH. Go to Table 03C to select the remaining characters. The question says the approach was open, so choose 0 for 5 th character. Select Z for both 6th and 7th characters. Put all the characters together: 03CH0ZZ.

### CASE 1: Craniotomy to remove acute subdural hematoma

- **==00C40ZZ==**

>**Rationale**: Hematomas are removed by evacuating the hematoma. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index for Evacuation/hematoma and you are directed to see Extirpation. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Extirpation/subdural space and you are directed to 00C4. In the ICD-10-PCS Tabular List, select the following characters. The correct response is 00C40ZZ. The root operation is extirpation for taking or cutting out solid matter from a body part. The body system is central nervous system. The term craniotomy indicates that a hole was cut into the cranium, thus, the approach is open. If a burr hole was drilled down through the cranium to perform the procedure, the approach would be percutaneous.

### Right below-knee amputation, proximal tibia/fibula:

- 0Y6F0ZZ
- 0Y6C0Z1
- **==0Y6H0Z1==**
- 0Y6H0Z3

>**Rationale**: Amputation is coded to root operation Detachment. Amputation is performed by disarticulation or cutting through the bone. The body part value is the site of the detachment, the right lower leg (below-knee) in our scenario. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index for Detachment/leg/lower/right and you are directed to 0Y6H0Z. Go to Table 0Y6 to select the 7 th character qualifier. A qualifier, if applicable, is assigned to further specify the level at which the extremity was detached. The disarticulation took place at the proximal portion of tibia/fibula, hence a qualifier of 1 is assigned to the 7th character. The following qualifiers exist for lower leg/arm detachment procedures:

- **High**
	- Amputation at the proximal portion of the shaft of the tibia/fibula or radius/ulna
- **Mid**
	- Amputation at the middle portion of the shaft of the tibia/fibula or radius/ulna
- **Low**
	- Amputation at the distal portion of the shaft of the tibia/fibula or radius/ulna

### Percutaneous chest tube placement for right pneumothorax:

- **==0W9930Z==**
- 0WH83YZ
- 0WH93YZ
- 0W9940Z

>**Rationale**: The root operation is Drainage and body system is Anatomical Regions, General. Drainage is defined as taking or letting out fluids or gases from a body part. Sometimes, a patient’s lung can be accidentally punctured, allowing air to gather in the pleural cavity, causing its collapse (called a pneumothorax). A chest tube is a hollow plastic tube, which is placed into the pleural cavity to drain fluid or air. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index for Drainage/pleural cavity/right, referring to 0W99. Go to Table 0W9 to select the remaining characters. The question says the approach was Percutaneous, so choose 3 for 5 th character. Select 0 for Drainage Device for 6th character. Select Z for 7th character. Put all the characters together: 0W9930Z.

### CASE 13: A physician performs a right shoulder arthroscopy with a coracoacromial ligament release

- **==0MN14ZZ==**

>**Rationale**: The root operation is Release and the body system is Bursae and Ligaments. Inspection procedures are not coded separately when performed to achieve the objective of the procedure, in this case, the release of the ligament, per ICD-10-PCS coding guideline B3.13. The objective of Release procedures is to free a body part from abnormal constraint. Release procedures are coded to the body part being freed. The procedure can be performed on the area around a body part, on the attachments to a body part, or between subdivisions of a body part that are causing the abnormal constraint. Some examples of Release procedures are adhesiolysis and carpal tunnel release. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Release/bursa and ligament/shoulder/right and you are directed to 0MN1. Go to Table 0MN to select the remaining characters. The question says the approach was arthroscopic, so choose character 4 for percutaneous endoscopic approach. The 6th and 7th characters have only one option: character Z. Put the characters together: 0MN14ZZ.

- Qualifier (Z) No Qualifier

### CASE 9: Exploratory right thoracotomy, right pneumonectomy

- **==0BTK0ZZ==**

>**Rationale**: The correct response is 0BTK0ZZ. The root operation is Resection since the whole lung is removed. A pneumonectomy is a removal of an entire lung. The thoracotomy — incision into the thoracic cavity — is the approach, which is an open approach. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index for Pneumonectomy, referring you to see Resection, Respiratory System 0BT. Go to Table 0BT to select the remaining characters. Select K for 4th character for Right Lung. Select 0 for 5th character for Open approach. The 6th and 7th characters have only one option: character Z. Put the characters together: 0BTK0ZZ.

### CASE 8: Diagnostic bronchoscopy of the left bronchus

- **==0BJ08ZZ==**

>**Rationale**: The correct response is 0BJ08ZZ. The root operation is Inspection. The bronchus is part of the tracheobronchial tree. Bronchoscopy is a procedure that looks inside the lung airways. It involves inserting a bronchoscope tube, with its light and small camera, through nose or mouth, down the throat into trachea, and to the bronchi and bronchioles of lungs. This procedure is used to find the cause of a lung problem. Assign body part 0 for tracheobronchial tree, since there is no body part for just the left bronchus. In that case, you go up to the next largest anatomical area listed. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index for Bronchoscopy, referring you to complete code 0BJ08ZZ. The Approach is Endoscopic, via a natural opening.

### A patient was admitted for a cholecystectomy. After the abdominal incision was made and retroperitoneum exposed, the patient developed an abnormal heart rhythm. Surgery was discontinued, the abdominal incision was closed, and the patient was returned to the nursing unit for a consultation with a cardiologist.

- 0WM80ZZ
- 0WJH3ZZ
- 0WJ20ZZ
- **==0WJH0ZZ==**

>**Rationale**: The procedure had to be discontinued as the patient went into an abnormal rhythm, so the root operation for the procedure is Inspection because no other procedures were carried out, according to ICD-10-PCS guideline B3.3. Look in the ICD-10-PCS Alphabetic Index for Inspection/retroperitoneum and you are directed to 0WJH. Go to Table 0WJH to select the remaining characters.

### CASE 5: Open coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) of one coronary artery with a greater saphenous vein graft, harvested endoscopically from left leg

**==021009W==**
**==06BQ4ZZ==**

>**Rationale**: Two codes are needed to report the procedures performed. The first is for the aortocoronary bypass, which is a bypass of one coronary artery to the aorta using an autologous (from the patient) venous graft. The second procedure code is for the graft procurement via the excision of the greater saphenous graft which was specified as being done via an endoscopic or percutaneous endoscopic approach. In an aortocoronary artery bypass, the blood is diverted from the aorta to a coronary artery. The body part value is 0 for one coronary artery bypassed.
