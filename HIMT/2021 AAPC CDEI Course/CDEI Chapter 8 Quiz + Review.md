## Clinical Conditions & Diagnosis Coding Pt. 2

### Newborn twin boys were delivered in the hospital via cesarean section at 26 weeks, weighing 756 grams for twin A and 850 grams for twin B. Both were diagnosed with extremely low birth weight and extreme immaturity. What ICD-10-CM codes are reported for both twins?

- P07.25, Z38.31
- ==Z38.31, P07.03, P07.25==
- P07.03, P07.25, Z38.31
- P07.25, P07.03

>**Rationale**: Per ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.16.a.2 indicates when coding the birth episode in a newborn record, assign a code from category Z38 Liveborn infants according to place of birth and type of delivery as the principal diagnosis. A code from this series is assigned only once to a newborn at the time of birth. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Newborn/twin/born in hospital/by cesarean, directing you to code Z38.31. In the Alphabetic Index also look for Low/birthweight/extreme/with weight of/750-999 grams directing you to code P07.03; both boys fall into this range. Additionally, look in the Alphabetic Index for Immaturity (less than 37 completed weeks)/extreme of newborn (less than 28 completed weeks of gestation)/gestational age/26 completed weeks directing you to code P07.25. Verify all code selections in the Tabular List. There is also an instructional note under category P07 to code the birth weight before the gestational age.

### What ICD-10-CM codes would be reported for a 34-year-old male patient admitted for chemotherapy for metastatic carcinoma of the right lung secondary to cancer of the right areola ?

- ==Z51.11, C78.01, C50.021==
- C78.01, C50.021, Z51.11
- Z51.11, C50.011, C78.01
- C22.9, C50.019, Z51.11

>**Rationale**: ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.2.e.2 states that if a patient admission/encounter is solely for the administration of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation therapy, assign code Z51.0 Encounter for antineoplastic radiation therapy , Z51.11 Encounter for antineoplastic chemotherapy , or Z51.12 Encounter for antineoplastic immunotherapy as the first listed or principal diagnosis. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, look for Encounter (with health service) (for)/chemotherapy for neoplasm guiding you to code Z51.11. Next, look in the Alphabetic Index for Metastasis, metastatic/cancer/from specified site and you are directed to see Neoplasm, malignant, by site. In the ICD-10-CM Table of Neoplasms, look for Neoplasm, neoplastic/lung and select the code from the Malignant Secondary column, guiding you to code C78.0-; code C78.01 indicates the malignancy is in the right lung. Next, look for Neoplasm, neoplastic/areola and select the code from the Malignant Primary column or Neoplasm, neoplastic/breast/areola and select the code from the Malignant Primary column, guiding you to subcategory code C50.0-. In the Tabular List, the 5 th character is reported for the sex of the patient. In this case, the patient is a male resulting in a 5 th character of 2. The 6 th character is for laterality; 1 is for right. The complete code is C50.021 for primary cancer of the right male areola. When assigning breast cancer codes, make sure to select for the correct sex of the patient. The secondary cancer is listed first because the chemotherapy is directed to the secondary site per ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.2.b. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### Phil, a 55-year-old male, is sent to the emergency room from his provider’s office for hypertension, CKD stage 4, and morbid obesity with a BMI of 39.2. He has never smoked and is negative for diabetes or proteinuria. He states he is working on his diet and lifestyle modifications to lose weight. His blood pressure is 185/105 (last measurement 165/102). His most recent labs are as follows:

Serum potassium = 3.7 mmol/litre  
Serum creatinine = 250 micromol/litre
eGFR = 27 mL/minute/1.73 m2  
Fasting total cholesterol = 3.4 mmol/litre  
Liver function and other U+Es are normal  
His medications include: lisinopril 20 mg daily, bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg daily, simvastatin 40 mg daily.  
The patient will be admitted for management of his hypertension and CKD.  

#### What are the ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes reported for this case?

- I12.9, N18.4, E66.01, E78.5
- ==I12.9, N18.4, E66.01, Z68.39==
- I10, N18.4, E66.01, Z68.39
- I10, N18.4, E78.5, E66.09

>**Rationale**: When a patient has hypertension with CKD, there is an assumed cause-and-effect relationship and a combination code is used. A secondary code for the CKD is used to further define the severity of the CKD. An instructional note at E66 states to code also the BMI, if documented. The patient is taking simvastatin, which likely means he has hyperlipidemia. Labs are listed (cholesterol) and his meds are refilled. Because the provider did not document hyperlipidemia, a query is needed in order to clarify the diagnosis and report it. To code the hypertension and CKD, begin in the Alphabetic Index under Disease/kidney/chronic/stage 4, which directs you to N18.4. Verify in the Tabular List. In the Tabular List, you are directed to code first any hypertensive chronic kidney disease. In the Alphabetic Index, go to Hypertension /kidney/with stage 1 through stage 4 chronic kidney disease, which directs you to code I12.9. Verify in the Tabular List. Per the coding convention listed under N18, code I12.9 as the principal diagnosis. In the Alphabetic Index, under Obesity/morbid, you are directed to code E66.01. Verify in the Tabular List. In Alphabetic Index under main term Body/mass index/adult/39.0-39.9, you are directed to code Z68.39. Verify selection in the Tabular List.

### A 58-year-old male patient arrived at the ED complaining of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. After initial workup by the ED physician, it was determined that the patient was suffering from an NSTEMI. Patient is a long-time cigarette smoker with type II diabetes, controlled with Metformin. Admitted patient and contacted cardiac cath lab for cardiac intervention. What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- I21.9, F17.219, E11.9, Z79.84
- I21.4, F17.210, E11.9
- I21.3, F17.210, E11.9, Z79.84
- ==I21.4, F17.210, E11.9, Z79.84==

>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Infarct, infarction/non-ST elevation (NSTEMI), which directs you to code I21.4. Verification in the Tabular List confirms code I21.4 as the correct code selection. Per the instructional note listed under I21.-, use additional code, if applicable, to identify tobacco dependence (F17.-). The patient is a cigarette smoker. In the Alphabetic Index look for Smoker, which directs you to see Dependence, drug, nicotine. Select cigarettes, directing you to code F17.210. Verification in the Tabular List confirms this code. Next, in the Alphabetic Index, look for Diabetes/type 2, which directs you to code E11.9. Verification in the Tabular List confirms E11.9 as the correct code. The instructional note under E11 directs you to use an additional code to identify control using oral antidiabetic drug with code Z79.84. Documentation states the patient’s diabetes is controlled with Metformin.

### Seven days following a surgical below the right knee amputation, a patient is directly admitted to the hospital by her provider. The provider notes that the amputation stump is not healing and appears infected. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with MRSA infection of the right knee stump. She was treated with wound care and IV antibiotic therapy. What ICD-10-CM coding is reported?

- S88.111D
- T87.40
- ==T87.43, B95.62==
- T87.43, A49.02

>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Complication (s) (from) (of)/amputation stump (surgical) (late) NEC/infection or inflammation/lower limb guiding you to subcategory T87.4-. The Tabular List shows that a 5 th character is needed to complete the code. The documentation states right laterality, so code T87.43 is the correct code assignment. Next, code for the type of infectious bacterium, MRSA. In the Alphabetic Index look for MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) infection/as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere, which directs you to code B95.62. Code A49.02 is designated for MRSA infection of an unspecified site. Code S88.111D is not reported because the encounter is not for a patient with a traumatic amputation. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### Which of the following codes would be reported if a patient was diagnosed with osteoarthritis in both knees and the documentation indicated it was due to a previous military injury that happened a few years ago?

- ==M17.2==
- M17.31, M17.32
- M17.5
- M17.9

>**Rationale**: The patient having osteoarthritis from a past injury is reported to a post-traumatic osteoarthritis code. The injury can be from a vehicle accident, fall, sports, military injury, or any other type of physical trauma. Documentation by a provider needs to indicate that the osteoarthritis is due to a post-traumatic event to report that specific code. Primary osteoarthritis is generalized “wear and tear” of the joint. Secondary osteoarthritis is when a patient has osteoarthritis due to an injury, heredity, or disease. Because there is a specific ICD-10-CM code for bilateral post-traumatic osteoarthritis, code M17.2 is reported.

### A 67-year-old male is admitted to the hospital after being bucked off his horse. The patient complains of severe upper left abdominal pain. After examination and imaging, a 2c m laceration to the spleen was found. The patient was immediately taken to the OR for emergency surgical intervention. What ICD-10-CM coding is reported?
		
- S36.039A, V80.010A
- ==S36.031A, V80.010A==
- S36.032A, V80.010A
- S36.030A, V80.010A

>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Laceration/spleen/moderate, which directs you to code S36.031-. Verification in the Tabular List confirms that code S36.031A is the correct code assignment for a 2 cm laceration; 7 th character A is selected for the initial encounter. Next, code the external cause code. In the External Causes Index look for Accident/transport/animal-rider/noncollision/specified as horse rider, which directs you to code V80.010-. Verification in the Tabular List confirms V80.010A as the correct code assignment.

### The discharge summary of a 21 year-old female indicates acute respiratory failure with hypoxia due to incorrect medication administration. Valium was administered instead of Xanax. What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?
		
- T42.4X5A, J96.00
- J96.01, T42.4X1A
- ==T42.4X1A, J96.01==
- T42.4X4B, J96.91

>**Rationale**: Poisoning codes are sequenced by 1) the poison code, and 2) the condition or manifestation. ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.19.e.5.b.i states examples of poisoning include “Errors made in drug prescription or in the administration of the drug by provider, nurse, patient, or other person.” In the ICD-10-CM Table of Drugs and Chemicals, find Valium and use the code from the Poisoning, Accidental (unintentional) column, which is T42.4X1. In the Tabular List the code requires a 7 th character and, in this case, the A is used for the initial encounter. The manifestation is respiratory failure. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, look for Failure, failed/respiration, respiratory/acute/with hypoxia, directing you to J96.01. Verify the code selection in the Tabular List. Per ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.19.e, no additional external cause code is required for poisoning, toxic effects, adverse effects, and underdosing codes.

### A 9-year-old female is brought to the ED by her mother. She was riding her bicycle in the park when she fell off the bike. She struck her head fairly hard on the pavement. According to her mother, she had loss of consciousness of about 30 seconds after hitting her head. The patient’s left arm is painful to touch, discolored, and swollen. The X-ray shows a closed displaced comminuted fracture of the ulna shaft that will require surgical intervention. Admit patient to monitor head injury and surgical treatment of ulna shaft fracture. What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- ==S06.9X1A, S52.252A, V18.0XXA, Y92.830==
- S06.9X0A, S52.255A, V18.4XXA, Y92.830
- S06.9X1A, S52.202A, V18.4XXA, Y92.831
- S06.9X0A, S52.252A, V19.9XXA, Y92.830

>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Injury/Intracranial, which directs you to S06.9-. Verification in the Tabular List confirms S06.9X1A is the correct code assignment. The patient had a loss of consciousness of 30 minutes or less. 7th character “A” is selected for initial encounter. In the Alphabetic Index look for Fracture, traumatic/ulna/shaft/comminuted (displaced), guiding you to subcategory S52.25-. The Tabular List indicates seven characters are needed to complete the code. The 6 th character 2 is for the left arm and the 7 th character A is for an initial encounter for closed fracture. To find the external cause codes, you will look in the ICD-10-CM External Cause of Injuries Index. Look for Accident (to)/transport/pedal cyclist/driver/noncollision accident/nontraffic, which guides you to subcategory V18.0. The Tabular List indicates an appropriate 7 th character is to be added to each code from category V18. You will need placeholder X for the 5 th and 6 th characters and the 7 th character is A for the initial encounter. The second external cause code identifies the place of occurrence. In the External Cause of Injuries Index look for Place of occurrence/park (public) directing you to code Y92.830. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### A 16-year-old patient is admitted from the ED for ringing in the ears, nausea, vomiting, and confusion. The patient admitted to taking a large amount of aspirin in a suicide attempt. Blood testing confirms aspirin poisoning. What ICD-10-CM coding is reported for this case?

- ==T39.012A, H93.13, R11.2, R41.0==
- T39.012A
- T39.012A, H93.11, H93.12, R11.0, R11.10, R41.0
- T39.011A, H93.13, R11.2, R41.0

>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Poisoning/drug, which directs you to see Table of Drugs and Chemicals. In the Table of Drugs and Chemicals look for Aspirin/Poisoning, intentional self harm, which directs you to code T39.012-. Verification in the Tabular List confirms code T39.012A as the correct code assignment, with 7 th character A for initial encounter. ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.19.e.5.b states “When coding a poisoning or reaction to the improper use of a medication (for example: overdose, wrong substance given or taken in error, wrong route of administration), first assign the appropriate code from categories T36-T50. Use additional code(s) for all manifestations of poisonings.” The codes for the manifestations are assigned next and are found in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index by looking for Tinnitus (ringing in the ear), directing you to H93.1-. Add 5 th character 3 for both ears; Nausea/with vomiting (R11.2); and Confusion (R41.0). Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### Phil, a 55-year-old male, is sent to the emergency room from his provider’s office for hypertension, CKD stage 4, and morbid obesity with a BMI of 39.2. He has never smoked and is negative for diabetes or proteinuria. He states he is working on his diet and lifestyle modifications to lose weight. His blood pressure is 185/105 (last measurement 165/102). His most recent labs are as follows:

Serum potassium = 3.7 mmol/litre  
Serum creatinine = 250 micromol/litre
eGFR = 27 mL/minute/1.73 m2  
Fasting total cholesterol = 3.4 mmol/litre  
Liver function and other U+Es are normal  
His medications include: lisinopril 20 mg daily, bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg daily, simvastatin 40 mg daily.  
The patient will be admitted for management of his hypertension and CKD.  

#### Which of the following would be an appropriate query for this scenario?

- Is there an underlying cause for the CKD?
- Did you neglect to include hyperlipidemia for this case?
- ==For which condition are you prescribing simvastatin?==
- Was a fasting glucose test overlooked when you were reviewing the lab results?

>**Rationale**: A query should never lead the physician to an answer. In option C, the provider is asked to clarify the condition for which the medication is prescribed. Simvastatin is prescribed for hyperlipidemia, which is not included in the provider’s documentation. Because the causal link because hypertension and CKD is assumed, you would not need to query the provider in this case.

### History and Physical:
Date of Exam: 9/26/20XX
Hospitalist : Timothy Cooper M.D.
Patient Name: Jessica Hughes
Date of Birth: 6/16/19XX
#### Chief Complaint: Right knee pain and swelling.
History of the Present Illness: The patient presented to the ED for right knee pain and swelling. She was subsequently admitted for pain management and treatment of suspected infection to the knee. The patient has a history of osteoarthritis grade IV of the bilateral knees and flexion contracture. The patient receives physical therapy. The subjective pain is on the bilateral knees, right worse than left.

Psycho: Awake, alert, and oriented times 4. No depression. 
Knee examination: Moderate right knee pain and swelling. Exam of the right knee reveals an infection to the right knee. Crepitance is 2, and active range of motion is 10 to 100 degrees and passive range of motion is 7 to 120 degrees. There is a flexion contracture at 10 degrees, right knee. Effusion is 1+ and ligaments are normal. The meniscal signs are absent. Exam of the left knee shows neurovascular status is normal. Crepitance is 2, and range of motion is 5 to 120 degrees. Effusion is 0 and ligaments are normal. The meniscal signs are absent.

Patient admitted for treatment of knee infection and pain management. Begin IV antibiotics.

#### Diagnoses: Cellulitis of the right knee, Osteoarthritis.

What diagnosis coding is reported for this case?

- L03.119, M17.11
- ==L03.115, M17.0==
- L03.115, M17.31, M25.561
- L03.115,M17.11, M25.561

>**Rationale**: In this case, the patient was diagnosed with cellulitis of the right knee. The chief complaint is right knee pain and swelling; however, the patient has bilateral osteoarthritis, and the right is worse than the left. You do not code the pain because pain is a symptom of osteoarthritis. Although a code can be determined, it is important to educate providers to document whether OA is primary or post-traumatic to select a more accurate code. It’s always important for them to indicate laterality. Laterality should also always be indicated as either unilateral or bilateral, as it is in this case. To code the cellulitis, begin in the Alphabetic Index under Cellulitis/lower limb and you are directed to L03.11. In the Tabular List, select 6th character 5 for cellulitis of right lower limb. To code the osteoarthritis, begin in the Alphabetic Index under Osteoarthritis/knee/bilateral, which directs you to code M17.0. Verify selection in the Tabular List.

### A 10-year-old ventilator-dependent patient is admitted for tracheostomy revision due to tracheo-esophageal fistula formation. Under general anesthesia and after establishing the airway to maintain ventilation, repair of the tracheostomy was successfully performed. What ICD-10-CM coding is reported?

- Z43.0, Z99.11
- ==J95.04, Z99.11==
- J95.09, Z43.0, Z99.11
- J95.09, J39.8, Z43.0

>**Rationale**: ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.19.g.5 indicates that intraoperative and postprocedural complication codes are found within the body system chapters with codes specific to the organs and structures of that body system. These codes are sequenced first, followed by a code(s) for the specific complication, if applicable. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Complications/tracheostomy/tracheo-esophageal fistula, directing you to code J95.04. Z43.0 Encounter for attention to tracheostomy is not reported. In the Tabular List Z43.0 has an Excludes1 note that excludes J95.0-. You also need to report the patient’s dependence on the ventilator. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Dependence/on/ventilator directing you to Z99.11. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### A 54-year-old patient sustained an open comminuted right calcaneal fracture and subdural hematoma after falling from a ladder. The patient was admitted for surgical intervention and prophylactic antibiotics. What are the ICD-10-CM codes for the fracture ONLY?

- S92.001D
- ==S92.001B, W11.XXXA==
- S92.009B, W11.XXXA
- S92.001D, W11.XXXD

>**Rationale**: A comminuted fracture is one in which a bone is broken, splintered, or crushed into a number of pieces; therefore, it is considered displaced. Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Fracture, traumatic/tarsal bone(s)/calcaneus directing you to subcategory S92.00-. The Tabular List indicates seven characters are needed to complete the code. The 6 th character 1 indicates laterality as right. The 7 th character B is selected for initial encounter for an open fracture. Verification in the Tabular List confirms S92.001B as the correct code assignment. In the ICD-10-CM External Cause of Injuries Index look for Fall, falling/from, off, out of/ladder directing you to category W11. In the Tabular List, there is a note that the code requires seven characters. The 4 th , 5 th , and 6 th characters are reported with placeholder Xs and the 7 th character chosen is A for initial encounter. The complete code is W11.XXXA. Verify code selection in the Tabular list.

### A 25-year-old male is admitted due to carbon monoxide poisoning from a gas furnace in his home. What ICD-10-CM coding is reported?

- T58.14XA, Y92.009
- T59.7X1A, Y92.009
- ==T58.11XA, Y92.009==
- T59.7X2A, Y92.009

>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Poisoning – see also Table of Drugs and Chemicals. In the Table of Drugs and Chemicals look for Carbon/monoxide/gas(piped), select accidental poisoning, which directs you to code T58.11. Verification in the Tabular List confirms code T58.11XA as the correct code assignment, with 7th character A for initial encounter. Next, in the External Causes Index, look for Place of Occurrence/home, which directs you to see also Place of Occurrence, residence code Y92.009. Verification in the Tabular List confirms Y92.009 as the correct code assignment.

### A 49-year-old male is admitted to the hospital for surgical intervention of a severe diabetic ulcer of the left heel. After examination of the left foot, it appears the ulcerated area involves the calcaneus with a small area of bone necrosis. What ICD-10-CM coding is reported for this scenario?

- E11.622, L97.524
- L97.424, E11.622
- E11.622, L89.626
- ==E11.622, L97.424==

>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Diabetes, diabetic (mellitus) (sugar)/with/skin ulcer NEC and you are directed to E11.622. In the Tabular List, below E11.622, there is a note to use an additional code to identify the site of the ulcer (L97.1-L97.9, L98.41-L98.49). A review of this code range identifies L97.424 Non-pressure chronic ulcer of left heel and midfoot with necrosis of bone . Look in the Alphabetic Index for Ulcer/lower limb/heel/left/with bone necrosis, which refers you to code L97.424. In the Tabular List, under category code L97, there is a note to code first any associated underlying condition, including diabetic ulcers and their corresponding codes. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### When coding diabetes which statement is TRUE?

- An additional code for type of diabetes (E10.- or E11.-) is coded for pregnant patients.
- If a patient is being treated with insulin and oral medications report codes Z79.4 Long-term (current) use of insulin and Z79.84 Long term (current) use of oral hypoglycemic drugs.
- ==Type of diabetes not documented in the medical record defaults to reporting a code from category E10.-.==
- When coding type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease (CKD) only report code E11.22. Do not report the CKD separately.

>**Rationale**: ICD-10-CM coding guideline I.C.4.a.2 indicates that if the type of diabetes mellitus is not documented in the medical record the default is E11.- Type 2 diabetes mellitus . If a patient is being treated with insulin and oral mediation, only the insulin controlled code is reported. Codes E10.- or E11.- are reported as additional codes when the pregnant patient has pre-existing diabetes. You need two separate codes when reporting diabetes with CKD. The Tabular List gives an instructional note under code E11.22 to also report the stage of the CKD.

### A 32-year-old patient is admitted to the hospital with severe uterine bleeding five days after she was discharged from the obstetric unit where she had a vaginal delivery of a healthy baby girl. What ICD-10-CM coding is reported for this scenario?

- O75.89, N93.9
- ==O72.1==
- O72.2
- N93.9

>**Rationale**: The postpartum period is also known as the puerperal period. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Puerperal, puerperium (complicated by, complications)/hemorrhage, which directs you to code O72.1. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### A 39-year-old male was admitted for a severe head injury after being involved in a fight at a local restaurant. The patient was struck from behind, fell, and hit his head on the concrete floor. The patient lost consciousness immediately for approximately 35 minutes and was transported to the hospital by EMS. After evaluation and imaging, the patient was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. What ICD-10-CM coding is reported?

- ==S06.6X2A, Y04.0XXA, Y92.511==
- S06.6X2D, Y04.0XXD, Y92.511
- S06.6X0A, Y04.0XXA, Y92.511
- S06.6X9A, Y04.0XXD, Y92.511

>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Injury, intracranial (traumatic)/subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic, which directs you to code S06.6X-. Verification in the Tabular List confirms S06.6X2A as the correct code assignment. Documentation indicates the loss of consciousness was 35 minutes, so 6 th character 2 is assigned, followed by 7th character A for the initial encounter. To report the circumstances surrounding the injury, look in the ICD-10-CM External Cause of Injuries Index for Brawl (hand) (fist) (foot) directing you to Y04.0-. In the Tabular List, placeholder Xs are used for the 5 th and 6 th characters and 7 th character A is selected for initial encounter. To report the place of occurrence, look in the External Cause of Injuries Index for Place of occurrence/restaurant directing you to Y92.511. The activity and external cause status are unknown so they cannot be reported. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### Emergency Department Note:
Subjective: The patient is a 75-year-old female who presents to the ED today for low blood sugars. She states that she only checks her blood sugars in the morning and those have all been ranging less than 70. She has not been checking two hours after meals. Her blood pressures when she does check them have been running normal as well but she does not have any record of these with her. She has a history of CAD. No other issues or concerns.
Medications: She is on Hyzaar 50/12.5 one-half p.o. daily, coated aspirin daily, lovastatin 40 mg one-half tab p.o. daily, multivitamin daily, metformin 500 mg one tab p.o. b.i.d.; however, she has been skipping her second dose during the day.
Social History: She has a history of smoking. Quit over 10 years ago.
Objective:
Vital Signs: Temperature: 98.2. Pulse: 64. Respirations: 16. Blood pressure: 110/56. Weight: 169. General: Alert and oriented x 3. No acute distress noted.
Neck: No lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, JVD or bruits. Lungs: Clear to auscultation.
Heart: Regular rate and rhythm without murmur or gallops present.
Musculoskeletal: She did have full range of motion of her shoulders. There is no swelling, crepitus or discoloration noted.
Medical Decision Making: Most recent hemoglobin A1c was 5.6 percent back in October 20XX. Most recent lipid checks were obtained back in July 20XX. We have not had this checked since that time. We will admit patient for blood sugar control with insulin titration. Continue aspirin, lovastatin, and Hyzaar while in hospital.

#### Assessment:
##### DM with hypoglycemia
##### Mixed hyperlipidemia
##### CAD
 
What are diagnosis codes are reported for this case?

- II0, E11.649, E78.2, I25.10, F17.211, Z79.4
- E11.9, E78.5, I25.10, F17.211, Z79.4, Z79.84, Z79.82.
- E10.9, E78.2, I25.10, Z87.891, Z79.84
- ==E11.649, E78.2, I25.10, Z87.891, Z79.84, Z79.82.==

>**Rationale**: Although the provider indicates the patient is checking her blood pressure at home, there is no indication the patient has hypertension (HTN). The patient is on Hyzaar, which is used to treat HTN, but without clarification in the record by the provider, it cannot be coded. This would prompt a query if the medication was continued in the hospital. The type of diabetes is not documented. According to the ICD-10-CM guidelines, you would report it as diabetes type 2. Although there is a coding guideline in place and a code can be determined, the provider should be educated to include the type of diabetes and any manifestation the patient has due to diabetes. The hyperlipidemia is documented as mixed. The patient has documented coronary artery disease (CAD), which is listed in the assessment. The patient also has a history of smoking, which is also documented in the assessment. To code the diabetes mellitus, begin in the Alphabetic Index under Diabetes/type 2/hypoglycemia and you are directed to E11.649 as a coma is not supported by the documentation. When verifying in the Tabular List notice there is a use additional note directing you to report the patient’s current control, which is by metformin or an oral hypoglycemic drug. Also report code Z79.84. Per guideline I.C.4.a.3, code Z79.4 should not be reported if insulin is given temporarily to bring a type 2 patient’s blood sugar under control during an encounter. To code the mixed hyperlipidemia, begin in the Alphabetic Index under Hyperlipidemia/mixed directing you to E78.2. To code the CAD, begin in the Alphabetic Index under Arteriosclerosis/coronary artery, which directs you to I25.10. To report the patient’s history of tobacco use, begin in the Alphabetic Index under History/personal/tobacco dependence, which directs you to Z87.891. A code should also be reported for the long-term use of aspirin. Begin in the Alphabetic Index under Long-term/aspirin, leading you to Z79.82. Verify all codes in the Tabular List.

### A 58-year-old female patient is admitted to the hospital for an extremely high fever, nausea, vomiting, and a UTI. The discharge summary lists the patient’s diagnosis as urosepsis. What ICD-10-CM coding is reported?

- A41.9, N39.0
- N39.0, A41.9
- R50.9, R11.2, N39.0
- ==Query the provider for clarification==

>**Rationale**: Per coding guideline I.C.1.d.1.a.ii, when the term “urosepsis” is documented, the provider should be queried for clarification. There is no default code in ICD-10-CM for urosepsis and it is not synonymous with sepsis.

### A 5 year old is admitted to the burn unit of a local hospital after pulling a pot of boiling water off the stove and spilling it on herself. She sustained 12 percent second-degree burns on her legs and 30 percent third-degree burns on her chest and arms. Total body surface area burned is 42 percent. What ICD-10-CM codes are reported for the burns (do not include external cause codes for the accident)?

- T21.21XA, T22.20XA, T24.209A, T31.43
- ==T21.31XA, T22.391A, T22.392A, T24.291A, T24.292A, T31.43==
- T21.31, T22.20, T24.209, T31.43
- T24.299A, T21.31XA, T22.399A, T31.31

>**Rationale**: ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.19.d.1 states to sequence first the code that reflects the highest degree of burn when more than one burn is present. In this case, the burns on her chest and arms are third degree and are reported first. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Burn/chest wall/third degree, referring you to subcategory T21.31. Because the question indicates arms and legs (plural), code multiple sites of the right and left upper and lower limbs. In the Alphabetic Index look for Burn/upper limb/multiple sites/left/third degree directing you to subcategory T22.392-, and Burn/upper limb/multiple sites/right/third degree directing you to T22.391-. Next, look for Burn/lower/limb/multiple sites/left/second degree directing you to subcategory T24.292-. Look for Burn/lower/limb/multiple sites/right/second degree directing you to subcategory T24.291-. The Tabular List indicates a 7 th character is needed for all of these codes; a placeholder X is required for T21.31. The 7 th character A is reported for the initial encounter. Refer to ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.19.d.6 for instructions on assigning a code from category T31 to report the extent of body surface involved. The 4 th character represents the total body surface area (TBSA) (all degrees) that was burned. The 5 th character represents the percentage of third-degree burns to the body. In the scenario, 42 percent is documented as the TBSA making 4 the appropriate 4 th character; 30 percent is third-degree burns, making 3 the 5 th character. In the Alphabetic Index look for Burn/extent (percentage of body surface)/40-49 percent/with 30-39 percent third degree burns, which directs you to code T31.43. The external cause codes would also be reported for the accident. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### A 65-year-old female patient is admitted for acute exacerbation of COPD and emphysema. She has a long history of tobacco dependency, in remission for the past year. She is dependent on oxygen. What ICD-10-CM coding is reported?

- J44.1, J43.9, F17.201, Z99.81
- J44.1, Z87.891, Z99.81
- ==J43.9, F17.201, Z99.81==
- J44.9, J43.9, F17.211, Z99.81

>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Disease/lung/obstructive (chronic)/with emphysema, which direct you to code J43.9. Verification in the Tabular List confirms J43.9 as the correct code assignment. Per the coding tip listed under J44.1, “Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with (acute) exacerbation, assign J43.9 when COPD exacerbation with emphysema is documented.” Under J43- there is an instructional note directing you to use an additional code to identify tobacco dependence. In the Alphabetic Index look for Dependency/drug/nicotine/with in remission, which directs you to code F17.201. Verification in the Tabular List confirms F17.201 as the correct code assignment. Type of tobacco dependency is not documented. Next, code for the oxygen dependency. In the Alphabetic Index look for Dependency/oxygen (long-term) (supplemental), which directs you to code Z99.81. Confirm the coding in the Tabular List.

### A 14-year-old male patient was injured while skateboarding. The injuries included an open displaced oblique fracture of the left femur shaft with multiple significant abrasions of the left thigh. The patient was admitted for surgical intervention of the femur fracture. What are the ICD-10-CM codes reported for this scenario?

- ==S72.332B, V00.138A, Y93.51==
- S72.92XB, S70.312A, V00.138A
- S72.332B, S70.312A, V00.138A, Y93.51
- S72.92XB, S70.312A, Y93.51

>**Rationale**: Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Fracture, traumatic/femur, femoral/shaft/oblique (displaced), which directs you to S72.33-. In the Tabular List, seven characters are needed to complete the code. The complete diagnosis code is S72.332B because the 6 th character is 2 for the left and this is the initial encounter for an open fracture identified with a 7 th character B. ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.19.b.1 states separate codes for more superficial injuries of the same site (such as abrasions) should not be assigned. To find the external cause code, look in the ICD-10-CM External Cause of Injuries Index for Accident/transport/pedestrian/conveyance (occupant)/skate board, guiding you to V00.138. In the Tabular List the 7 th character A is chosen for initial encounter. Next, report an external cause code for the activity by looking for Activity/skateboarding in the Index to External Causes of Injuries, guiding you to Y93.51. There is no mention of the place of occurrence, so it is not coded. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### At 38 weeks gestation, a 23-year-old female is admitted for precipitous labor. Her baby girl was delivered vaginally and resulted in a second-degree perineal laceration, which was successfully repaired after delivery. What ICD-10-CM coding is reported on the maternal record?

- O80, O70.1, Z38.00, Z3A.37
- O80, 062.3, O70.1, Z38.00, Z3A.37
- ==O62.3, O70.1, Z37.0, Z3A.37==
- O62.3, O70.1, O80, Z37.0, Z3A.37

>**Rationale**: The labor is precipitous. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, look for Delivery (childbirth) (labor)/complicated/by/precipitate labor directing you to O62.3. ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.15.n.1 states that code O80 is reported for a full-term normal delivery of a single, healthy infant without any complications antepartum, during the delivery, or postpartum during the delivery episode. Code O80 is not to be reported with any other pregnancy complication code from chapter 15. In this case, O62.3 and O70.1 are reported for the complications of delivery and the normal delivery code (O80) is not reported. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Precipitate labor or delivery, which directs you to code O62.3. Next, in the Alphabetic Index look for Laceration/perineum/female/during delivery/second degree, directing you to code O70.1. Verification in the Tabular List for both codes confirm the correct code assignment. The outcome of delivery is also reported. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Outcome of delivery/single/liveborn directing you to Z37.0. Code Z38.00 is only to be used on the newborn’s record, not the maternal record. At the beginning of chapter 15, there is a note to use an additional code to report the weeks of gestation. The patient is 37 weeks gestation. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Pregnancy/weeks of gestation/37 weeks directing you to Z3A.37. Verify the code selection in the Tabular List.

### Case 1 Discharge Diagnoses
1. Altered mental status d/t UTI
2. UTI
3. Type 1 DM, uncontrolled, hyperglycemic
4. Neuropathy

Hospital Course
Cynthia is a 59-year-old female with a history of DM I, and neuropathy, who was brought by EMS for altered mental status. As per the ER physician, the patient was talking with her neighbour when she started acting very confused. In the ER, her blood sugars were very high. She complains of severe burning during urination. Cultures grew E.coli which was the source of her UTI.

Vitals: BP 100/80, Pulse 66, Temp. 98.8°F, Resp. 17

Physical Examination
General: NAD
Head: Normocephalic
Eyes: PERRL
ENT: Pharynx normal
Neck: Supple
Respiratory: Lungs CTA
Cardiovascular: Regular rate, rhythm, no edema, no murmur
Abdomen: Normal bowel sounds, non-tender, soft
Back: Normal inspection
Extremities: L great toe amputation

Discharge disposition: Home with home health and physical therapy
Total time spent on discharge: 35 minutes. This includes examination of the patient, discharge planning, medication reconciliation, and communication with other providers.

#### What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- N39.0, B96.20, E11.40, E11.65, Z89.411
- ==N39.0, B96.20, E10.40, E10.65, Z89.412==
- N39.0, A41.51, E10.40, E10.65,
- N39.0, A41.51, E10.40, Z89.412

>**Rationale**: The patient presents with an altered mental status secondary to her UTI caused by e.coli. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, look for Infection/urinary tract, leading to N39.0. Next, look for Infection/Escherichia coli/as a cause of disease classified elsewhere, leading to B96.20. When coding diabetes mellitus, use as many codes from categories E08-E13 as necessary to describe all of the complications and associated conditions of the disease. In the Alphabetic Index, look for Diabetes (type 1)/with/neuropathy, leading to E11.40. Next, look for Diabetes (type 1)/with/hyperglycemia, leading to E10.65. In the physical examination, the provider noted that the patient has a left great toe amputation. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Absence/toe/great, leading to Z89.412. Verify all codes in the Tabular List.

### Case 2 Discharge Diagnoses
1. Ventricular fibrillation d/t STEMI
2. Cardiac arrest d/t vfib
3. STEMI
4. MI (2 weeks ago)

Hospital Course
Peter is a 50-year-old male who presented to the hospital with acute onset chest pain. While being evaluated, he went to the bathroom and went into ventricular fibrillation which required CPR. He was sent to the cath lab and afterward monitored in the ICU. Mr. Williams was admitted just two weeks ago with an MI. His blood pressure was out of control. He was able to ambulate post cath without further chest pain. He was educated on the need to take Plavix for a year. He is a plumber that requires heavy lifting, and he will have to be out of work for 6 weeks or cleared by his cardiologist.

#### What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- I43.91, I46.2, I22.9, I25.2
- I46.9, I46.2, I22.9, I21.9
- I22.9, I49.01, I46.2, I25.2
- ==I22.9, I49.01, I46.2, I21.9==

>**Rationale**: Principal diagnosis is the STEMI. A code from category I22, Subsequent ST elevation (STEMI) and non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction, is to be used when a patient who has suffered a type 1 or unspecified AMI has a new AMI within the four-week time frame of the initial AMI. A code from category I22 must be used in conjunction with a code from category I21. The sequencing of the I22 and I21 codes depends on the circumstances of the encounter. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Infarction/myocardium/subsequent/ST elevation, leading to I22.9. For the acute MI that occurred two weeks prior, look in the Alphabetic Index for Infarction/myocardium, leading to I21.9. Verify all codes in the Tabular List. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, look for Fibrillation/ventricular, leading to I49.01. The patient went into cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. Look for Arrest/cardiac/due to/cardiac condition, leading to I46.2.

### Case 3 Discharge Diagnoses
1. ESRD, HD MWF
2. Uncontrolled DM II w/ polyneuropathy
3. Right heel decubitus ulcer, stage 3
4. Hypertension

Hospital Course
Brianna is a 46-year-old female who was admitted with shortness of breath and chest pain. She was found to be in acute renal failure. Her cardiac workup was negative. On admission she continued to accumulate fluids despite albumin repletion. Over the next few hours, she was noted to have increasing oxygen needs overnight and she required semi-urgent bilateral thoracentesis. She was started on hemodialysis (HD) last year and has been going to dialysis MWF, but she would like to be trained for home HD for her ESRD. Neurology was consulted for her severe polyneuropathy in both feet. We will switch her from Gabapentin to Lyrica.

In summary, the patient came in with severe generalized anasarca. After many years of uncontrolled (hyperglycemic) DM II, she previously evaded doctors and did not want treatment until the anasarca caused significant respiratory distress. She was motivated to work with PT/OT who suggested rehab. Medical assistance was obtained for her to receive rehab services, but she refused going to a SNF for inpatient rehab. She is competent to make this decision and she has decided to go home. We helped her with setting up in-home PT services.

Brianna was also found to have a decubitus ulcer of the right heel. Initially, she was admitted with a stage 2 ulcer of the right heel, but then it evolved into a stage 3 ulcer. Dr. Singh was on consult for infectious disease and will follow cultures. Her hypertension was controlled during her stay and she will continue on Furosemide, Losartan, and Carvedilol.

Discharge condition: Stable
Discharge disposition: Home/Self care

#### What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- ==E11.22, I12.0, N18.6, Z99.2, N17.9, E11.42, E11.65, L89.612, L89.613==
- E11.22, I12.0, N18.6, Z99.2, N17.9, E11.42, E11.65, E11.621, L97.412, L97.418
- E11.9, N18.6, N17.9, Z99.2, E11.42, E11.65, E11.65, L89.612, L89.613
- E11.22, I12.0, N18.6, Z99.2, N17.9, E11.42, E11.65, L89.613

>**Rationale**: When coding diabetes mellitus, use as many codes from categories E08-E13 as necessary to describe all of the complications and associated conditions of the disease. In the Alphabetic Index, look for Diabetes (type II)/chronic kidney disease, leading to E11.22. According to the ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.9.a.2., a relationship is assumed between hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Hypertension, hypertensive/kidney/with/stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end stage renal disease, referring you to I12.0. Verify in the Tabular List. An instructional note indicates to “Use additional code to identify the stage of chronic kidney disease (N18.5, N18.6).” Look for Disease/end stage renal (ESRD) , leading to N18.6. See the instructional note in the Tabular List to “Use an additional code to identify dialysis status Z99.2.” Look in the Alphabetic Index for Status/dialysis, leading to Z99.2. Next, look for Injury/kidney/acute, leading to N17.9. Neurology was consulted for the patient’s severe polyneuropathy in both feet. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Diabetes/polyneuropathy, leading to E11.42. The patient has uncontrolled (hyperglycemic) diabetes mellitus. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Diabetes (type II)/hyperglycemia, leading to E11.65. Decubitus ulcers are an open skin wound sometimes known as a pressure ulcer, bed sore, or pressure sore. A decubitus ulcer forms where the pressure from body the body’s weight presses the skin against a firm surface, such as a bed or wheelchair. These types of ulcers are not associated as a diabetic complication since they are caused by constant pressure over bony prominences. During the patient’s inpatient stay, her heel ulcer evolved from a stage 2 to stage 3. According to the ICD-10-CM guidelines, if a patient is admitted to an inpatient hospital with a pressure ulcer at one stage and it progresses to a higher stage, two separate codes should be assigned: one code for the site and stage of the ulcer on admission and a second code for the same ulcer site and the highest stage reported during the stay. In the Alphabetic Index, look for Ulcer/decubitus/pressure by site/stage2/heel, leading to L89.612. The stage 3 ulcer of the right heel is coded to L89.613. Verify all codes in the Tabular List.

### Case 4 Discharge Diagnoses
1. Syncope
2. Right ankle sprain
3. HIV dementia

Hospital Course
This 46-year-old male presents with a history of HIV dementia. The patient came in because of a loss of consciousness. It appears that he sprained his ankle during one of his syncopal episodes. His lab work was unremarkable. He was seen by cardiology, neurology, and orthopedics.

Vitals: BP 99/60, Pulse 60, Temp. 98.7°F, Resp. 20
Physical Examination
Cardiovascular: S1 and S2
Lungs: Diminished air entry
Abdomen: Soft
Neurologic: The patient is alert, cheerful. Does not appear to be in distress.
Musculoskeletal: Right swollen ankle
Plan: At this time, the patient is going to be discharged home on his home medications. His orthostatics have been negative, and he has been cleared from cardiology and neurology service.
Time taken for discharge planning and coordination of care was in excess of 32 minutes.

#### What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- ==R55, S93.401A, B20, F02.80==
- R55, S93.401D, Z21, F02.80
- R55, S93.401A, Z21, F03.90
- R55, S93.401A, B20, F03.90

>**Rationale**: The patient presents for syncope. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, look for Syncope, leading to R55. During his syncopal event, the patient sprained his right ankle. In the Alphabetic Index, look for Sprain/ankle, leading to S39.401A. Next, look for Dementia/in/human immunodeficiency virus, leading to B20 [F02.80]. Verify all codes in the Tabular List.

### Case 5 Discharge Diagnoses
1. Congenital biliary atresia
2. Direct hyperbilirubinemia
3. Ileus 2/2 meconium

Hospital Course
Jonathan is a 20 day old male who presents for congenital biliary atresia. The patient was scheduled for a liver biopsy and cholangiogram. Percutaneous liver biopsies were sent for frozen section and that was confirmatory for biliary atresia. He underwent a Kasai procedure. Jonathan remained on total parental nutrition (TPN) for 6 days. The Blake JP drain was removed after 4 days. The patient remained on Zosyn until he was tolerating enteral feeds. His pain was well controlled with oral medications. He was stooling and urinating appropriately. He was deemed stable for discharge and will follow up with pediatric surgery in one week.

Physical Examination
Constitutional: Infant male lying in hospital crib, no apparent distress. Awake and alert. Jaundiced.
Head: NCAT. Fontanelle open, soft, flat
Pulmonary/Chest: Breathing comfortably on room air. No increased work of breathing.
Abdomen: Soft, mild abdominal distention. Appropriately tender at surgical incision
Musculoskeletal: Normal range of motion
Neurological: He is alert
Skin: Skin is warm. Jaundice.
Disposition: Home with parents.

#### What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- K83.1, P59.9, P76.0
- K80.51, P59.9, K55.7
- ==Q44.2, P59.9, P76.0==
- Q44.2, R17, K55.7

>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, look for Atresia/bile duct, leading to Q44.2. Next, look in the Alphabetic Index for Hyperbilirubinemia/neonatal/see Jaundice/newborn, leading to P59.9. The patient was also diagnosed with ileus due to meconium. Look for Ileus/newborn/due to meconium, leading to P76.0. Verify all codes in the Tabular List.

### This 27-year-old male was admitted to the hospital with severe LLQ abdominal pain. He is having nausea and vomiting and has vomited five times within the past two hours. CT scan shows possible colitis. Laboratory tests were within normal limits except for his SED rate, which was three times above the normal limit. The patient does have a history of rheumatoid arthritis and polyneuropathy and follows up with his rheumatologist monthly. He was discharged with Prednisone 20 mg daily for one week. Continue on Gabapentin for polyneuropathy. What ICD-10 codes are reported for this case?

- K52.9, M06.9, G62.9
- ==K52.9, M05.50==
- K51.90, M05.50
- K52.9, M06.9, G63

>**Rationale**: If the diagnosis documented at the time of discharge is qualified as “probable,” “suspected,” “likely,” “questionable,” “possible,” or “still to be ruled out,” “compatible with,” “consistent with,” or other similar terms indicating uncertainty, code the condition as if it existed or was established. In the Alphabetic Index, look for Colitis, leading to code K52.9. Next, look for Rheumatoid/polyneuropathy, leading to code M05.50. Verify all codes in the Tabular List.

### Sharon presents with pain on her right side around her back and hip. After workup, she was diagnosed with a sprain of her sacroiliac joint. What ICD-10 code is reported for this case?

- S33.6XXD
- ==S33.6XXA==
- S33.6XXS
- S43.431D

>**Rationale**: In the Alphabetic Index, look for Sprain/sacroiliac/joint, leading to code S33.6xxA.

 ### In ICD-10-CM, sequela are indicated by which of the following seventh characters?

- D
- A
- ==S==
- B

>**Rationale**: In ICD-10-CM, sequela are indicated by the seventh character S.

 ### Tanya has been admitted with colon cancer for colostomy. She has a hx of left breast cancer in remission. Which of the following codes(s) is/are assigned in addition to a code for the colon cancer?

- C50.912
- ==Z85.3==
- C50.912, Z85.3
- Z85.9

>**Rationale**: According to the ICD-10-CM guidelines, when a primary malignancy has been previously excised or eradicated from its site and there is no further treatment directed to that site and there is no evidence of any existing primary malignancy at that site, a code from category Z85, Personal history of malignant neoplasm, should be used to indicate the former site of the malignancy. In the Alphabetic Index, look for History/personal/malignant/breast, leading to code Z85.3.

### Which of the following is NOT a symptom of preeclampsia?

- Swelling in the feet, legs, and hands
- Severe headaches
- Visual disturbances
- ==Increased urine output==

>**Rationale**: Symptoms of preeclampsia include swelling in the feet, legs, and hands; severe headaches; visual disturbances; and decreased urine output.

### Which statement is TRUE for coding chronic kidney disease (CKD)?

- When both hypertension and CKD are final diagnoses you report codes I10 and N18.5.
- ==There is always a causal relationship between hypertension and CKD, unless the provider indicates the CKD is not related to the hypertension.==
- A code from category N18, Chronic kidney disease, should be reported as a primary code with a subsequent code from category I13, Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease.
- A code from category I12, Hypertensive chronic kidney disease, is the only code to report for both hypertension and CKD.

>**Rationale**: Refer to ICD-10-CM coding guideline I.9.a.2. There is always causal relationship between hypertension and CKD, unless the provider indicates the CKD is not related to the hypertension. When both hypertension and conditions coded to category N18.- Chronic kidney disease (CKD) are present, assign a code from category I12.- and report the appropriate code from category N18.- as a secondary code. A code from category N18.- is also coded as a secondary code with a code from category I13.

### A 59-year-old male patient is admitted to the hospital after experiencing a severe headache, confusion, and slurred speech. The patient does not recall any recent trauma or falls. He was ultimately diagnosed with a brain hemorrhage. The discharge summary states the patient suffered a subdural hemorrhage. What ICD-10-CM coding is reported?

- I60.00
- S06.5X0A
- I62.01
- ==I62.00==

>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Hemorrhage, hemorrhagic/subdural (nontraumatic), which directs you to code I62.00. Verification in the Tabular List confirms I62.00 as the correct code assignment. The documentation does not indicate the hemorrhage was due to a fall, which eliminates code S06.5X0A. The documentation also does not indicate the subdural hemorrhage is acute. It would be incorrect to assign I62.01.

### An 18-year-old female was rushed to the ED after being found unconscious in her home. The history from family members indicated the patient had left a suicide note and had taken a large amount of LSD (a hallucinogenic). She was admitted for unconsciousness and bradycardia due to suicide attempt with intentional overdose of a hallucinogenic substance. What ICD-10-CM codes are reported?

- T40.8X2A, R40.2440, R94.31
- ==T40.8X2A, R40.20, R00.1==
- T40.8X1A, R40.20, R94.31
- T40.8X1A, R40.4, R00.1

>**Rationale**: According to ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.19.e.5.b.ii, an overdose of a drug intentionally taken is reported as a poisoning. ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.19.e.5.b states that a poisoning is reported by first assigning the poisoning code (categories T36-T50), followed by a code for each manifestation. Any diagnosis of drug abuse or dependence is assigned as an additional code. Look in the ICD-10-CM Table of Drugs and Chemicals for LSD and select the code from the Poisoning, Intentional Self-harm column, which directs you to T40.8X2-. In the Tabular List, 7 th character A is selected for the initial encounter. The manifestations are unconsciousness and bradycardia. Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Unconscious(ness), which states to see Coma, which directs you to R40.20. In the Tabular List, Unconsciousness NOS is an inclusion term under R40.20. In the Alphabetic Index look for Bradycardia, which directs you to code R00.1. There is no mention of drug abuse or drug use outside of the suicide attempt. According to ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.19.e, the codes for poisoning include the intent and the substance taken; no additional external cause code is required.

### A 37-year-old female, who is 29 weeks pregnant with her second child, is admitted for suspected preterm labor. During the examination, the obstetrician detects bradycardia in the fetus but preterm labor is ruled out and the patient is discharged. What are the ICD-10-CM codes reported for this scenario?

- O36.8330, Z33.1, Z3A.29
- O36.8390, Z34.82, Z3A.29
- O36.8330, Z3A.29
- ==O36.8330, O09.523, Z3A.29==

>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Pregnancy/complicated (by)/abnormal, abnormality/fetal heart rate or rhythm, guiding you to O36.83-. The 6th character is 3 because the patient is in her third trimester at 29 weeks. 7th character 0 is reported for a single gestation. Refer to the beginning of chapter 15 in the Tabular List that indicates what the certain number of weeks are for the trimesters. Pregnancy after age 35 is considered an elderly pregnancy. In the Alphabetic Index, look for Pregnancy/complicated by/elderly/multigravida (because this is her second pregnancy), guiding you to subcategory code O09.52-. In the Tabular List, the 6th character 3 is reported to indicate the patient is in her third trimester. For a listing of trimesters by weeks, see the beginning of ICD-10-CM chapter 15. There is also a note at the beginning of chapter 15 indicating to use an additional code from category Z3A to identify the specific week of the pregnancy. Locate code Z3A in the Tabular List indicating Z3A.29 is the correct code for 29 weeks gestation or look in the Alphabetic Index for Pregnancy/weeks of gestation/29 weeks directing you to Z3A.29. Codes Z33.1 and Z34.82 are only reported when there are no complications documented. Verify code selection in the Tabular List. The preterm labor is not coded as the condition was ruled out.

### A baby girl was born via vaginal delivery in the hospital. The record had ABO incompatibility documented. A negative Coomb's test was also documented. This effectively ruled out the ABO incompatibility and no treatment was provided. What ICD-10-CM codes are reported for the newborn’s record?

- O36.1190, Z38.00, Z03.79
- P01.8, Z38.00
- Z38.00, P55.1
- ==Z38.00, Z05.8==

>**Rationale**: According to ICD-10-CM guideline 1.C.15.a.2, chapter 15 codes are only used on the maternal record. Per ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.16.a.2, when coding the birth episode in a newborn record, assign a code from category Z38 Liveborn infants according to place of birth and type of delivery as the principal diagnosis. Code Z38.00 is found in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index by looking for Newborn (infant) (liveborn) (singleton)/born in hospital. Verification in the Tabular List confirms code Z38.00 for vaginally delivered infant. ABO incompatibility was documented but ruled out due to the Coomb’s test being negative. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Observation/newborn (for)/ruled out/specified condition NEC referring you to Z05.8. Report only codes Z38.00 and Z05.8.
