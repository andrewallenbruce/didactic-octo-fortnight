# Chapter 1
## **Purpose of Inpatient CDI**
### Which of the following is an aspect of a retrospective review rather than a concurrent review?
- Accuracy of a working MS-DRG
- Accuracy of ICD-10-CM and PCS codes
- ==POA indicators and discharge status codes==
- There is no difference between a concurrent and retrospective review

>**Rationale**: A retrospective review generally includes reviewing the documentation for deficiencies included in a concurrent review such as MS-DRG accuracy, ICD-10-CM and PCS accuracy; but may also include reviewing POA indicators and discharge status codes as these may not be fully captured during the patient’s stay or are only assigned on discharge/final coding. 

### Which statement is TRUE regarding concurrent reviews?
- ==Past and present conditions that are related or clinically significant should be documented.==
- Concurrent review audits are performed after the patient is discharged.
- Orders for diagnostic or ancillary services do not require a rationale and justification can be inferred.
- It is not important for health risk factors to be identified.

>**Rationale**: Concurrent review includes reviewing the documentation for [[medical necessity]] along with the following: Orders for diagnostic or ancillary services should include a rationale, which can be easily inferred if it is not specifically documented; past and present conditions that are related or clinically significant conditions should be documented; health risk factors should be identified; patient’s progress and response to treatment should be clear and support charges; accuracy, acuity, and specificity of ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS codes; identification of hospital acquired conditions (HAC); accuracy of working MS-DRG; review of other deficiencies related to quality documentation and assignment of queries.

### Reimbursement for inpatient care is directly correlated to which of the following?
- Geographical location
- Medical claims
- ==Case mix index (CMI)==
- Diagnosis related group (DRG)

>**Rationale**: Because a hospital’s case mix index (CMI) reflects the severity level of procedures and care required to treat patients at their facility, [[CMS]] uses this measure to determine reimbursement.

### The job functions of a CDEI involves which of the following?
- Insurance underwriting review and concurrent review
- ==Concurrent review and retrospective review==
- Retrospective review and insurance underwriting review
- Concurrent review and prospective payment review

>**Rationale**: During a concurrent review, a patient’s record is reviewed while they are actively admitted. Depending on the facility, concurrent reviews can take place for each patient, each day of care. Or the facility may have a policy that coders review records daily and that every few days the patient’s record is reviewed by a CDI. Either way, a concurrent review includes reviewing the documentation for medical necessity. A retrospective review is done after the patient is discharged and the claim is processed. Retrospective reviews can be part of an [[audit]] function performed by CDEIs at some facilities. Audits can include all claims or focus on specific MS-DRGs, diagnoses, or procedures. A retrospective review generally includes reviewing the documentation for deficiencies in a similar manner as a concurrent review, but may also include review of present on admission indicators (POA), discharge status codes, query response at time of billing, medication reconciliation, patient education on discharge, SOI/ROM capture, CC/MCC capture, and other patient safety indicators.

### It is recommended that the provider document within how many hours of care being provided, including after the patient is discharged
- 32 minutes
- 48 hours
- ==24 hours==
- 72 hours

>**Rationale**: The best way to achieve the most accurate, detailed documentation is for the provider to document the encounter/services within 24 hours of care being provided. Most facilities will have a policy that sets a time limit for record completion. Hospitals will also have a policy for the time limit for authentication of an electronic health record, which typically ranges from 24 hours to a few days.

### Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding quality assurance of patient care?
- The provider can rely on the patient to inform them of their history during an inpatient stay. 
- Providers do not have to rely on the documentation of other physicians in the inpatient setting, only their own.
- The patient survey and ROS does not matter in the inpatient setting and do not need to be documented.
- ==Quality assurance of patient care is only evident if it is documented in the medical record.==

>**Rationale**: Quality assurance in patient care is only evident if it is documented in the medical record. Quality services may have been provided; however, if this is not evident within the medical record, problems may arise.

### Which of the following is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to find key information from unstructured written or spoken processes?
- A CDI
- ==An NLP==
- A CAC
- A DRG

>**Rationale**: The NLP is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to find key information from unstructured written or spoken processes. Use of CAC is commonly seen for accurate code selection, but still requires manual review.

### Examples of common deficiencies in the medical record that are simple to prevent include all of the following EXCEPT?
- Incomplete sentences
- Misspelled words
- ==Misdiagnosis==
- Missing dates of service

>**Rationale**: Additional examples of common deficiencies that are simple to prevent include sloppy text, phrases that do not make sense, incomplete dictation, incorrect dates of service, missing dosage, and missing orders.

### What is an example of a challenge of CDI in nursing home facilities?
- Obtaining compliant plan of care from the admitting hospital
- ==Proper reimbursement for services performed by other providers==
- Deficiencies not being identified until after the provider has left the facility
- Focusing on preventive medicine services

>**Rationale**: An example of a challenge in this type of facility is the proper reimbursement for services performed by other providers when the patient is in a nursing home. The nursing home is responsible for coordinating care for patients admitted to their care.

### All of the following are examples of a deficiency EXCEPT?
- Missing date of service on a progress note
- Missing an order for a medication
- A discharge summary missing a signature 
- ==A chart that has not been audited==

>**Rationale**: A chart that has not been audited is not a deficiency, a deficiency would require review or a query from a provider or other clinician. Audits can be assignments or job requirements of a coder, CDEI professional, or auditor and are not considered a chart deficiency.

### Which statement is TRUE regarding an effective method for communicating documentation deficiencies to a provider?
- Provide documentation tips for the most common chronic conditions treated.
- Provide the documentation deficiency report quarterly.
- Provide a report to the medical director that includes the findings for all the providers in the practice.
- ==Provide references from reputable sources such as CMS.==

>**Rationale**: When communicating with a provider, it’s helpful to provide references from reputable sources, such as CMS, as this will not only provide credibility, but also will increase the level of knowledge you are providing to the physicians. When providing feedback to a provider regarding documentation deficiencies, the most effective action is to provide examples of their own documentation with feedback for improvement because it allows them to understand the deficiency and how to improve.

### Which of the following is NOT an area a CDEI should monitor to reduce risk?
- Informed consent
- Assignment of benefits
- HIPAA consent forms
- ==AHA Coding Clinics==

>**Rationale**: CDEI should help to establish, maintain, and monitor policies and procedures to reduce risk including informed consent, assignment of benefits, and [[HIPAA]] consent forms.

### There is heightened awareness and demand for clinical documentation improvement. Which of the following is the main reason?
- Reprocessing claims
- Recouping underpayments
- Less audits being performed
- ==Increasing regulatory demands for evidence-based patient care==

>**Rationale**: Additional reasons for heightened awareness and demand for clinical documentation improvement include patient involvement, increasing use of the [[electronic medical record]] (EMR), more frequent audits performed with the intent to recover payments, and to aggressively investigate and enforce compliance through audits, [[Overpayment and Recoupment|recoupment]], and denial of payments.

### Which of the following is/are considered basic steps for setting up educational objectives?
- Determine who needs the training and the type of training that best suits the facility’s needs.
- ==Determine who needs the training, the type of training that best suits the facility’s needs, when and how often education is needed, and how much each person should receive.==
- Determine who needs the training, the type of training that best suits the facility’s needs, and where training should take place.
- Determine who needs the training, the type of training that best suits the facility’s needs, where training should take place, when and how often education is needed, and how much each person should receive.

>**Rationale**: Training may be accomplished through a variety of means, including in-person training sessions (i.e., either onsite or at outside seminars), distribution of newsletters, or even a readily accessible office bulletin board. Regardless of the training modality used, a facility should ensure that the necessary education is communicated effectively and that the facility’s employees come away from the training with a better understanding of the issues covered.

### As a CDEI professional monitoring documentation for multiple providers involved in a single patient’s care is a challenge for which of the following facility types?
- Nursing home facilities 
- Home health facilities
- Ambulatory surgical centers
- ==Inpatient hospitals==

>**Rationale**: One of the main challenges facing a CDEI working at an Inpatient hospital is monitoring documentation for multiple providers involved in patient care. This happens often during extended periods of stay because hospitalists may rotate who is on call and there may be several different consulting specialists involved in diagnosing and treating the patient.

### What is one reason why a CDEI should train the provider on the importance of detailed and quality documentation?
- ==There is a gap between clinical standards and the coding systems.==
- It helps justify the need for CDI programs and provides job security.
- It will completely eliminate the need to query providers.
- It will help providers with time management.

>**Rationale**: The CDEI must train providers on the importance of detailed and quality documentation. Most providers have an inherent knowledge of what should be documented for clinical standards; however, there is a gap between clinical standards and the coding systems.

### Which is an example of an internal documentation guideline that a facility might use to ensure accurate medical record documentation?
- Assumptive coding is acceptable.
- ==The medical record is complete and legible.==
- ICD-10-CM and CPT® codes are always used for inpatient claims.
- The patient’s preferred pharmacy must be listed for accurate coding.

>**Rationale**: Additional internal guidelines include: 
>
>(1) The documentation of each patient encounter includes the reason for the encounter; any relevant history; physical examination findings; prior diagnostic test results; assessment, clinical impression, or diagnosis; plan of care; and date and legible identity of the observer 
>
>(2) If not documented, the rationale for ordering diagnostic and other ancillary services can be easily inferred by an independent reviewer or third party who may not have medical training; 
>
>(3) ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS codes used for claims submission are supported by documentation and the medical record; and 
>
>(4) Appropriate health risk factors are identified. The patient’s progress, their response to, and any changes in, treatment, and any revision in diagnosis are documented.

### What statement is TRUE regarding clinical documentation improvement?
- CDI is solely directed toward reimbursement.
- Implementing a CDI program in a facility will only impact the HIM department.
- ==Successful CDI programs focus on supporting the documentation of clinical conditions, treatment and management of the conditions, and outcomes of treatment.==
- CDI is not an inherent part of coding and auditing.

>**Rationale**: The central focus of all clinical documentation should be to demonstrate the quality of care provided to the patient with detail and accuracy to facilitate optimum patient care.

### Which of the following is NOT a responsibility of a CDEI specialist?
- To verify documentation has supporting clinical indicators for medical necessity purposes
- Educate physicians on proper use of copy and paste within the electronic health record
- ==Document services rendered to ensure documentation is complete and [[Timely Filing|timely]]==
- Review documentation of conditions is clearly supported in the medical record

>**Rationale**: The CDEI specialist is not responsible for documenting services rendered. The CDEI will assist with documentation improvement, including EHR use medical necessity. Such reviews are often used as additional resources to better educate coders and providers, if needed.
			
### How soon after a service is provided to a patient should a provider complete documentation?
- ==As soon as possible, typically within 24 hours or at most a few days==
- There are no hospital policies indicating timeframes and providers can take months
- Physicians and midlevel’s are allowed 7 days and nursing staff 24 hours
- Critical services such as ICU or Emergency Department care should be documented within an hour
			
>**Rationale**: Generally documentation should be completed as soon as possible, regardless of where the service was performed or by who. Typically, this means within 24 hours or at most a few days. Hospitals will have individual policies indicating requirements. 
			
### The CDEI will be responsible for all of the following, EXCEPT:
- Provide physician education on how documentation for coding can be different than clinical standards
- Review medication and allergy lists for updates and negative effects of cloning
- Act as a liaison between the coder and the provider for documentation deficiencies
- ==Review the professional claims of the hospitalists to verify proper evaluation and management coding==

>**Rationale**: The CDEI is not responsible for reviewing the professional coding component of documentation as that will fall under the responsibilities of the outpatient CDI specialist. As a CDEI specialist, a person will be required to make sure all inpatient documentation if accurate and clear for validation of inpatient services.
			
### Which of the following is a job responsibility of a CDEI?
- Review claim submissions to make sure they were billed properly
- ==Review for improper use of acronyms or other deficiencies==
- Create a report to see how many patients are discharged on a daily basis
- Analyze records to determine how many patients each provider is seeing

>**Rationale**: As a CDEI specialist, you will review the documentation for acronyms or other deficiencies, such as missing signatures. CDEI do not review claims submissions or other billing related responsibilities, these are generally handled by a billing department. CDEI are also not responsible for capturing data on how many patients are discharged or how many patients a provider is seeing on a daily basis.

### The goal of an effective CDI program includes all of the following, EXCEPT?
- Accurate reporting of ICD-10-CM
- ==Accurate reporting of [[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]] codes==
- Decrease in physician queries
- Proper MS-DRG assignment

>**Rationale**: An effective inpatient CDI program includes accurate reporting of ICD-10-CM and PCS codes, as well as proper MS-DRG assignment. Generally, there is a decrease of provider queries and the quality of queries improve. CPT codes are not used to report inpatient procedures and therefore are not a way to measure an effective CDI program.

### Developing internal policies is beneficial to every hospital. All of the following are examples of appropriate policy development EXCEPT:
- Policy to add late entries
- Policy to timeliness of documentation
- Policy for risk prevention
- ==Policy for record retention==

>**Rationale**: A CDEI specialist is not required to develop policies for record retention. This function will fall under the medical records department and the manager. They will be the ones responsible to create a proper compliant policy for the time frame to keep medical records stored in adherence to HIPAA and other policy.
			
### As a CDEI specialist, you are reviewing a record in which a patient was admitted for possible concussion, cervicalgia with suspected fracture; a fractured sternum with mild deformity and severe pain; and multiple rib fractures with pain and contusions after a motor vehicle accident. 
The physician orders an MRI of the neck, thoracic X-ray, and an X-ray of the left lower extremity. The results of the cervical MRI are normal and thoracic X-ray reflect previously documented fractures in sternum and ribs. The concussion and cervical fractures are ruled out. Surgery is not indicated and the patient is discharged. On discharge the patient is given narcotics and orders for physical therapy. Which service is not medically supported?

- The MRI of the neck
==- The X-Ray of the left lower extremity==
- The hospital admission
- The narcotic prescription

>**Rationale**: The MRI of the neck is supported as patient was admitted for cervicalgia (neck pain) and had a motor vehicle accident. The chest X-ray is also supported by clinical indicators. The admission is supported based on the level of injuries sustained. The Narcotic prescription is supported as the patient was diagnosed with severe fractures. B is the correct answer, as there is no diagnosis or documentation of signs and symptoms to support the need for an X-ray of the leg.

### Which of the following does NOT meet the definition of a medically necessary service?
- A newborn with suspected sepsis who required lab workup
- ==A patient diagnosed with an ear infection had a chest X-ray performed==
- A patient with leukopenia, fevers, and frequent infections who requires a lumbar puncture
- A patient with a foreign body in the esophagus who underwent an EGD

>**Rationale**: A chest X-ray would not be medically necessary for a patient with an ear infection as the ear infection would not correlate to chest-related or breathing issues.

 ### Which of the following is a type of review CDEI performs while the patient is admitted?
- Prospective review
- Retrospective review
- ==Concurrent review==
- None, only coders perform chart reviews

>**Rationale**: A concurrent review is performed while the patient is still admitted. Prospective reviews are hardly used in the inpatient setting as they require prior knowledge and review of past patient records prior to admission. A retrospective review is performed after discharge and after the claim is processed. Coders may perform some reviews depending on the facility in conjunction with CDEI, but rarely do CDEI not perform some form of documentation review. 

### A CDEI uses tools to complete documentation reviews to improve the medical record in the form of deficiencies or provider queries. Which of the following would NOT prompt a CDEI to assign a deficiency?
- Use of the abbreviation q.o.d in a progress note
- An incomplete time stamp on a procedure report
- An illegible line of documentation in an H & P
- ==Use of the abbreviation q.i.d in the discharge summary==

>**Rationale**: The abbreviation q.i.d is generally acceptable, though some hospitals may have their own policies on it’s use, and in instances where that is not the case a deficiency should be assigned. However, the use of abbreviation q.o.d is on the “Do Not Use” list released by the Joint Commission. This would prompt the assignment of a deficiency. A deficiency would also be assigned anytime a signature or time stamp was missing or incomplete on a medical record. Illegible documentation should also be assigned a deficiency in order maintain the clarify of the record.
