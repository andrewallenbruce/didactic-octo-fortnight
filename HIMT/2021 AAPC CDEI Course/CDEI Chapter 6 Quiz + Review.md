## **ICD-10-CM**
### Which diagnosis below would be considered a combination code?

- Q61.2
- R78.0
- ==N30.01==
- E06.0

>**Rationale**: Refer to ICD-10-CM guideline I.B.9 for the definition of a combination code. Code N30.01 reports both cystitis and hematuria.

### A male patient with shortness of breath and cough is admitted to the hospital. An X-ray of the chest is ordered, and results show pneumonia. The patient is discharged home on antibiotics. Discharge diagnosis: Likely bacterial pneumonia. What the correct diagnosis code?

- ==J15.9==
- J12.9
- J12.89
- J15.8

>**Rationale**: The patient was diagnosed with likely bacterial pneumonia, in the inpatient setting conditions deemed “likely”, “suspected”, or other similar terms are coded as if they exist. Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Pneumonia/bacterial, which directs the coder to J15.9. Verification in the Tabular List confirms code selection.

### A 20 year old comes into the ED with symptoms of a severe headache, vomiting, stiff neck, and fever. The ED physician suspects meningitis and performs a lumbar puncture. The ED physician reviews the results, and the patient is admitted to the hospital for meningitis, which is suspected to be bacterial. The discharge diagnosis is methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) meningitis. What ICD-10-CM code(s) is/are reported for this admission?

- G00.3, R51.9, R11.10, M43.6, R50.9
- ==G00.3, B95.62==
- G00.3
- G00.9, B95.62

>**Rationale**: The symptoms for this scenario (headache, vomiting, stiff neck, and fever) are associated with meningitis (definitive diagnosis). ICD-10-CM guideline I.B.4 states signs and symptoms that are associated routinely with a disease process should not be assigned as additional codes. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Meningitis/bacterial/staphylococcal and you are directed to G00.3. Verify code selection in the Tabular List and follow the use additional code note to further identify the organism from codes B95.61-B95.8.

### Which diagnosis code(s) should be reported for a patient with primary amenorrhea due to ovarian dysfunction?

- N91.0
- ==E28.9==
- E28.9, N91.0
- N91.0, E28.9

>**Rationale**: Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Dysfunction/ovarian, directing you to E28.9. Verify selection in the Tabular List. In the Alphabetic Index look for Amenorrhea/primary, leading you to N91.0. When verifying in the Tabular List notice the Excludes1 note for ovarian dysfunction indicating that the code is excluded and should never be used at the same time as the code below the Excludes1 note. You only need to report one code for this diagnosis: E28.9.

### What is the meaning of provider in the ICD-10-CM guidelines?

- The hospital
- The insurance company
- ==The physician==
- The patient

>**Rationale**: The ICD-10-CM guidelines introduction states that the term provider means physician or any qualified healthcare practitioner who is legally accountable for establishing the patient’s diagnosis.

### The diagnosis caudal cervical inflammatory spondylopathy is assigned ICD-10-CM code M46.82 and is an example of what ICD-10-CM coding convention?

- Etiology/manifestation
- Unspecified
- ==NEC==
- NOS

>**Rationale**: The abbreviation NEC (not elsewhere classifiable) is used in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index to indicate there is no separate code for the condition even though the statement may be in great detail. In the Tabular List, these conditions may include words such as “other.” In the Alphabetic Index look for Spondylopathy/inflammatory/specified type NEC/cervical region.

### What is the ICD-10-CM code for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)?

- P22.0
- J96.00
- R06.03
- ==J80==

>**Rationale**: Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Syndrome/acute respiratory distress and you are directed to J80. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### What is the ICD-10-CM code for acute blood loss anemia?

- R58
- D64.9
- ==D62==
- D50.0

>**Rationale**: Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Anemia/blood loss/acute, which directs you to D62. Verify code selection in the Tabular List and note that this code description is acute hemorrhagic anemia.

### What diagnosis code(s) should be reported for a patient with polyneuropathy due to beriberi?

- G62.9, E51.11
- ==E51.11==
- G62.9
- E51.11, G63

>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index look for Polyneuropathy/in (due to)/beriberi, which directs you to E51.11. There is an inclusion note stating the code also covers beriberi with polyneuropathy. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### The patient is a 12-month-old male admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with a history of muscle weakness. Unfortunately, his etiology is unknown and to help delineate the diagnosis neurology has requested a right bicep muscle biopsy. Discharge diagnosis: muscle weakness of unknown etiology. What diagnosis code is reported?

- P96.89
- R53.1
- G58.9
- ==M62.81==

>**Rationale**: Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Weak, weakening, weakness/muscle and you are directed to M62.81. Verification in the Tabular List confirms code selection.

### What is the ICD-10-CM code for a subsequent encounter for a traumatic subdural hemorrhage without loss of consciousness?

- ==S06.5X0D==
- S06.5X0A
- I62.00
- S06.5X1D

>**Rationale**: Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Hemorrhage, hemorrhagic/subdural and you are directed to see Hemorrhage/intracranial/subdural. Follow that path to subdural/traumatic and you are directed to see Injury/intracranial/subdural hemorrhage. In the Alphabetic Index, look for Injury/intracranial/subdural hemorrhage (traumatic), leading you to S06.5X-. Verify code selection in the Tabular List for duration of loss of consciousness and 7 th character selection of D for subsequent encounter.

### What do the terms in parentheses indicate after Carotenosis in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index?

- Carotenosis cannot be coded unless one of those words is documented with hypertension in the diagnosis.
- ==They are supplementary words that can be present or absent with the diagnosis carotenosis and does not affect the code to which it is assigned.==
- Carotenosis needs two codes assigned.
- Look at another main term to find that type of carotenosis.

>**Rationale**: ICD-10-CM guideline I.A.7 states parentheses are used to enclose supplementary words that may be present or absent in the statement of disease or procedure without affecting the code number to which it assigned.
	
### A 45-year-old female with malignant right ovarian cancer-causing precocious puberty is also found to have new metastatic cancer to the liver. Patient is being admitted today for continuation of chemotherapy. What is the ICD-10-CM coding?

- C57.7, C56.1, E30.1
- C56.1, C57.7, Z51.11
- ==Z51.11, C56.1, E30.1, C78.7==
- Z51.11, C56.1, C78.7

>**Rationale**: ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.2.e.2 states if a patient admission/encounter is solely for administration of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation therapy, assign codes Z51.0, Z51.11, or Z51.12 as the first-listed or principal diagnosis. The malignancy for which the therapy is being administered should be assigned as a secondary diagnosis. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, look for Chemotherapy (session) (for)/cancer, leading to Z51.11. Next, look in the ICD-10-CM Table of Neoplasms for Ovary and select the code from the Malignant Primary column, which directs you to C56.-. The 4 th character is 1 for right. Go to Liver in the Table of Neoplasms and select code C78.7 from second column for Malignant Secondary. In the Alphabetic Index, look for Precocious/puberty, which directs you to E30.1. Verify the code in Tabular List.

### What is the sequencing order when coding a sequela (late effect)?

- The symptom is coded first, followed by the residual condition and the late effect code.
- The cause of the late effect is coded first; the residual condition is coded second followed by the symptoms.
- The cause of the late effect is coded first, and the residual condition is coded second.
- ==The residual condition is coded first and the code(s) for the cause of the late effect is coded as secondary.==

>**Rationale**: Per ICD-10-CM guideline 1.B.10, coding of sequela (late effects) generally requires two codes sequenced in the following order: the condition or nature of the late effect is sequenced first, and the late effect code is sequenced second. Exceptions to this guideline are those instances where the code for the late effect is followed by a manifestation code in the Tabular List and title or the late effect code has been expanded to include the manifestation.

### What diagnosis code(s) is/are reported for behavioral disturbances and wandering in a patient with late onset Alzheimer’s with delirium?

- F02.81, G30.0, F05, Z91.83
- ==G30.1, F02.81, F05, Z91.83==
- G30.8, F02.81, F05, Z91.83
- F02.81, Z91.83

>**Rationale**: In the Alphabetic Index, look for Disease/Alzheimer’s/early onset/with behavioral disturbance guiding you to codes G30.1 [F02.81]. A code in brackets is reported as an additional diagnosis. There is an instructional note in the Tabular List under category code G30 that states use additional code to identify manifestation as well as any codes for delirium. You see dementia with behavioral disturbance listed as an additional code. When you go to code F02.81 in the Tabular List there is an instructional note under category F02 to code first Alzheimer’s (G30.-).

### NEC and NOS are ___ used in the ICD-10-CM code book.

- ==Abbreviations==
- Essential modifiers
- Qualifiers
- Eponyms

>**Rationale**: ICD-10-CM guideline I.A.6.a states NEC and NOS are abbreviations. NEC is an abbreviation for Not Elsewhere Classifiable and NOS is an abbreviation for Not Otherwise Specified.

### What section of the ICD-10-CM guidelines contains instructions on how to code for a patient with a suspected COVID-19 infection?

- Section II
- ==Section I==
- Section IV
- Section III

>**Rationale**: Section I Conventions, general coding guidelines, and chapter-specific guidelines has specific instructions for coronavirus-19 infections in subsection I.C.1.g.

### The instructions and conventions of the classification take precedence over ______

- ==Official coding guidelines==
- Documentation
- ICD-10-PCS
- Nothing. They are only used in the event of no other instruction.

>**Rationale**: The ICD-10-CM guidelines introduction states the instructions and conventions of the classification take precedence over guidelines.

### What diagnosis code(s) should be reported for osteoarthritis of the left hip due to a fracture six months ago?

- ==M16.52==
- M16.12
- M16.50
- M16.32

>**Rationale**: Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Osteoarthritis/posttraumatic/hip/left, which directs the coder to M16.52. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### What diagnosis code(s) is/are reported for pneumonia for a patient who has been on a mechanical ventilator for the last two weeks?

- J95.851
- J95.851, J18.9
- ==J18.9==
- J95.851, J18.0

>**Rationale**: ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.10.d.1 indicates ventilator-associated pneumonia should be assigned only when the provider has documented ventilator-associated pneumonia. Code J95.851 should not be assigned for cases where the patient has pneumonia and is on a mechanical ventilator and the provider has not specifically stated the pneumonia is ventilator-associated pneumonia. Only code pneumonia with code J18.9 by looking under Pneumonia in the Alphabetic Index. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### What diagnosis codes should be reported for congenital aortic septum?

- ==Q25.49==
- Q25.40
- Q25.46
- Q25.41

>**Rationale**: Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Congenital /aortic septum, which directs you to Q25.49. Verify the code in the Tabular List.

### A patient is admitted to the hospital for severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. After examination and a computerized axial tomogram (CT scan), the patient is diagnosed with a ruptured peritoneal abscess. What ICD-10-CM coding is reported?

- R10.0, R11.2, R50.9
- L02.215
- ==K65.1==
- L02.91

>**Rationale**: Refer to ICD-10-CM guideline I.B.5. The abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting are not reported because they are symptoms of the peritoneal abscess. Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Abscess/peritoneum, peritoneal (perforated) (ruptured), which directs the coder to K65.1. Verification in the Tabular List confirms code selection.
	
### Who are the parties responsible for providing the ICD-10-CM guidelines?

- AAPC and AMA
- ==NCHS and CMS==
- AMA and CMS
- WHO and CMS

>**Rationale**: The ICD-10-CM guidelines introduction states the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) provide the guidelines for coding and reporting using ICD-10-CM.

### What is the ICD-10-CM code for pneumonia due to coronavirus-19?

- ==U07.1, J12.82==
- J12.81
- U07.1
- J12.82, U07.1

>**Rationale**: Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Coronavirus/coronavirus-19 or Coronavirus/COVID-19. You are directed to U70.1. The instruction in the Tabular List for U70.1 says to See Official Guidelines I.C.1.g for correct COVID-19 coding. Under ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.1.g.1.c.i are the sequencing and coding instructions for COVID-19 pneumonia. This guideline also provides instruction to use code J12.89 for reporting pneumonia due to coronavirus-19.

### A 50-year-old female is admitted with symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, and tachycardia. She is diagnosed with impending myocardial infarction. What diagnosis code(s) should be reported?

- I21.9
- I46.9
- ==I20.0==
- R07.9, R06.02, R00.0

>**Rationale**: ICD-10-CM guideline I.B.11 states to reference the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index to determine if the condition has a subentry for impending or threatened and reference main term entries for Impending and Threatened. If the subterms are listed, assign the given code. If the subterms are not listed, code the existing underlying condition(s) and not the condition described as impending or threatened. Look in the Alphabetic Index for Impending/myocardial infarction, which directs the coder to I20.0. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### What instruction does the coding convention under diagnosis code R87.82 provide?
- This additional code should never be reported with R87.82.
- This additional code should be sequenced before R87.82.
- ==This additional code should be sequenced after R87.82.==
- That a different code should be coded instead of R87.82.

>**Rationale**: The “Use additional code” coding convention indicates codes that should be sequenced after a primary code, if that information is available, to provide a more complete picture of the diagnosis. In this case, the note states “Use additional code for associated human papillomavirus (B97.7),” so the CDEI should assign R87.82 followed by B97.7, if documentation supports the additional code.

### Which of the following is a complete diagnosis code?
- I83.9
- F14.12
- M85.66
- ==K30==

>**Rationale**: I83.9 has the symbol indicating a 5th character is needed. F14.12 and M85.66 both have the symbol indicating a 6th character is needed. Though just three characters in length, K30 is a complete diagnosis code for functional dyspepsia.

 ### Which of the following conditions is not included in D68.2 Hereditary deficiency of other clotting factors?
- ==Rosenthal’s disease==
- Congenital afibrinogenemia
- Owren’s disease
- Proaccelerin deficiency

>**Rationale**: Reviewing the list of conditions under D68.2 reveals that only Rosenthal’s disease is not included in D68.2. (Rosenthal’s disease would be reported with code D68.1.)

### Which of the following words is an essential modifier in this example from the Index?
*Hypertension, hypertensive (accelerated) (benign) (essential) (idiopathic) (malignant) (systemic)
borderline
cardiorenal
cardiovascular*

		I.	Benign
		II.	Borderline
		III. Malignant
		IV.	Cardiorenal
		V.	Accelerated

- I, III, V
- ==II, IV==
- I, II, III
- I, II, IV

>**Rationale**: Essential modifiers are subterms below the main term. Nonessential modifiers are subterms that follow the main term and are enclosed in parentheses; they can help clarify the diagnosis but are not required. Accelerate, benign, and malignant are all nonessential modifiers, leaving borderline and cardiorenal as the essential modifiers.

### Jessica is admitted to the hospital with nephropathy and diabetes. What ICD-10-CM code(s) is reported?

- E11.9, N28.9
- N28.9, E11.9
- ==E11.21==
- E10.21

>**Rationale**: The word with appearing in the ICD-10-CM Index or Tabular can mean “associated with” or “due to.” Terms indented under the term with in the Alphabetic Index are presumed to have a causal relationship between the two conditions. In the Index, looking up Diabetes/with/nephropathy points you to E11.21. Verify this code in the Tabular List. You will not need two codes because E11.21 is a combination code that identifies both the diabetes and the nephropathy.

### How would you look up multiple sclerosis in the ICD-10-CM Index?

- ==Sclerosis, sclerotic/multiple (brain stem) (cerebral) (generalized) (spinal cord)==
- Multiple/sclerosis
- Disease/sclerosis/multiple (brain stem) (cerebral) (generalized) (spinal cord)
- Sclerosis/spinal cord (progressive)

>**Rationale**: To find the correct diagnosis code for multiple sclerosis, start with the broadest term “sclerosis.” From there, locate the essential modifier “multiple.” This will direct you to code G35. Verify this code in the Tabular List.

### What does guideline I.C.19.e.5.b.2 discuss?

- Low birth weight and immaturity status
- Pressure ulcers documented as healing
- ==Overdose of a drug intentionally taken==
- Interaction of drugs and alcohol

>**Rationale**: Use the ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines Index to narrow down your search. Start with 1.C.19.e, which will direct you to which page of the guidelines to begin your search. From there, continue locating your subsections until you find the one titled “Overdose of a drug intentionally taken.”
			
### John is admitted with a gangrenous stage 3 pressure ulcer of the right upper back. What diagnosis(es) are assigned?

- L89.113
- ==I96, L89.113==
- L89.113, I96
- I96, L89.114

>**Rationale**: Locate Ulcer/pressure/back in the Alphabetic Index, which will direct you to code L89.1. Verify the code in the Tabular List to determine the remainder of the code. Note that under the main L89 category, there is a note that directs you to Code first any associated gangrene (I96). This lets you know the gangrene should be coded first, with the pressure ulcer diagnosis coded after it.

### Joan presents to the emergency department with chest pain and SOB. The physician orders an X-ray and documents suspected pneumonia. The provider admits the patient to the hospital for treatment with IV antibiotics. What diagnosis code(s) is(are) assigned?

- J69.0
- ==J18.9==
- J18.9, R07.9, R06.02
- R07.9, R06.02

>**Rationale**: ICD-10-CM guideline II.H states that when the patient is in the inpatient setting and there is no confirmed diagnosis, the CDEI can code the “suspected” diagnosis as though it is confirmed. Because the patient was admitted to the inpatient setting, you should assign J18.9 as the principal diagnosis. 

 ### Joan is admitted for suspected pneumonia. After admission, Joan’s condition worsens. The admitting physician also notes her type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension in his H&P and chooses to continue her home medication dosages. Wednesday evening, Joan complains of squeezing chest pressure and jaw and back pain. She is diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction. When her chart is coded, which of the following diagnoses will receive a POA indicator of Y?
 
		I. Pneumonia
		II.	Acute myocardial infarction
		III. Type 2 diabetes mellitus
		IV.	Hypertension

- II and III
- I and II
- ==I, III, and IV==
- I, II, III, and IV

>**Rationale**: The POA indicator of Y is only assigned when the patient has the condition at the time of admission. Joan’s pneumonia and her chronic conditions of diabetes and hypertension were present at the time of her admission. The acute MI began after her admission and would, therefore, receive a POA indicator of N.

### What is the ICD-10-CM code for a type 3 sacrum fracture, initial encounter?

- S32.130A
- S32.16XB
- S32.10XA
- ==S32.16XA==

>**Rationale**: Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Fracture/sacrum/Type 3, which directs the coder to S32.16XA. In the Tabular List, determine that the 6 th character is a placeholder X. This code also indicates a 7th character is required. A is selected for the initial encounter and closed fracture.

### According to the Tabular List in the ICD-10-CM code book, category code I11 Hypertensive heart disease includes what other conditions?

- I51.7 Cardiomegaly
- I51.5 Myocardial degeneration
- I51.9 Heart disease, unspecified
- ==All of the above==

>**Rationale**: Look for code I11 in the Tabular List of the ICD-10-CM code book. In the includes box is a note that appears under the three-character category code to further define or give examples of what is accepted in that category.

### What is the ICD-10-CM code for urethral abscess?

- N35.816
- N39.8
- ==N34.0==
- T80.29XA

>**Rationale**: Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Abscess/urethra, leading you to N34.0. Verify code selection in the Tabular List. There is an instructional note to use additional code to identify the organism. There is no information of the infectious agent, therefore no additional code is reported.

### A 32 year old is admitted to the hospital for surgery to remove a lump in the lower outer quadrant of the right breast. Her mother and aunt both have a history of breast cancer. At the time of discharge, pathology is still pending. What diagnosis code(s) should be reported?

- N63.23
- N63.13, Z85.3
- N63.23, Z15.01
- ==N63.13, Z80.3==

>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, look for Lump/breast/right/lower outer quadrant N63.13. Next, look for History/family (of)/malignant neoplasm (of)/breast, which directs the coder to Z80.3. According to ICD-10-CM guideline IV.J, history codes (Z80-Z87) may be used as secondary codes if the historical condition or family history has an impact on current care or influences treatment. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### Using the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, identify the main term (below) that has an instructional note indicating another main term may also be referenced that provides additional useful Alphabetic Index entries.

- Diabetes
- Edema
- ==Dorsolateral==
- Facet syndrome

>**Rationale**: Look for the main term Dorsolateral in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index. The main term Dorsolateral has a note to see also Degeneration, combined. This note instructs you to go to another main term if additional information of the diagnosis cannot be found under the first main term. Refer to ICD-10-CM coding guideline I.A.16.

### Refer to the Tabular List and identify the code that contains an instructional note that indicates that the two related conditions cannot occur together.

- ==R83.5==
- S04.0-
- K31.84
- A18.01

>**Rationale**: Code R83.5 has an Excludes1 note for colonization status (Z22.-) indicating that the diagnosis colonization status is not reported with code R83.5.

### A 10 month old is admitted to the hospital with a fever of 101.4 and hematuria. She is diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI). Urine cultures confirm Escherichia coli as the bacteria that caused the UTI. Antibiotics are ordered to treat the infection. The physician also notices a rash that has developed on her leg and treats it with hydrocortisone cream. What ICD-10-CM coding is reported for this admission?

- N39.0, R21
- R31.9, R50.9, R21
- N39.0, B96.20
- ==N39.0, B96.20, R21==

>**Rationale**: Signs and symptoms that are associated with a disease process should not be reported, per ICD-10-CM guideline I.B.5. ICD-10-CM codes R31.9 Hematuria, unspecified and R50.9 Fever, unspecified are not reported because both are symptoms of the urinary tract infection (UTI). Codes for signs and symptoms that are not routinely associated with a definitive diagnosis should be reported, according to ICD-10-CM guidelines 1.B.4 and I.B.5. The rash is reported because it is not related to or associated with the UTI and was evaluated and treated during the admission. Look for Infection/urinary (tract) in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, referring you to code N39.0. Look for Rash in the Alphabetic Index, referring you to code R21. Verify both codes in the Tabular List. N39.0 has a use additional code note instructing you to code the infectious agent (if known) from code range B95-B97.

### In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, what is the code next to the main term called?

- Unspecified code
- Subcategory code
- Category code
- ==Default code==

>**Rationale**: The Alphabetic Index uses the same main term/subterm indexing systems. In ICD-10-CM, the code listed next to the main term is considered the default code. The default code represents the condition most commonly associated with the main term. As with all code assignment, always verify the default code in the Tabular List to ensure proper reporting. Refer to ICD-10-CM guideline I.A.18.

### A patient was seen by his PCP today who suspects patient has acute gastroenteritis causing dehydration. The PCP refers the patient directly to the hospital for direct admission for dehydration. Given the history and physical examination, the provider treated the patient with antibiotics and hydration infusion. The provider’s findings are dehydration due to viral acute gastroenteritis. What diagnosis code(s) is/are reported?

- E86.0, K52.9
- A08.4, E86.0
- K52.9, E86.0
- ==E86.0, A08.4==

>**Rationale**: The patient is specifically admitted for dehydration treatment. Gastroenteritis generally can be treated as an outpatient; however, in the provider’s opinion the patient needed acute hospital care. Therefore, the dehydration is the condition which precipitated the patient’s admission. Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Dehydration, which directs you to E86.0. Look for Gastroenteritis/acute/viral, which directs you to A08.4. In the Tabular List, the 5 th character 3 is selected for bilateral.

### What does ICD-10-CM stand for?

- ==International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision, Clinical Modification==
- International Class Diagnosis 10th Book, Clinical Medicine
- Infections Classified Diseases 10th Revision, Clinical Modification
- International Code Diagnosis-10, Coding Medical
	
>**Rationale**: The ICD-10-CM code book introduction states that the abbreviation stands for International Classification of Diseases 10 th Revision, Clinical Modification.

### What ICD-10-CM code is reported for a baby diagnosed with trigonocephaly?

- ==Q75.0==
- Q75.3
- Q75.1
- Q75.8

>**Rationale**: Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Trigonocephaly you are directed to Q75.0.

### What diagnosis codes should be reported for spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy due to previous illness of meningitis?

- ==G80.0, G09==
- G03.9, G80.0
- G09, G80.0
- G80.0, G43.909, G03.9

>**Rationale**: The spastic cerebral palsy is a sequela (late effect) of meningitis. ICD-10-CM guideline I.B.10 indicates the coding of sequelae (late effects) generally requires two codes. The condition or nature of the late effect is sequenced first. The late effect code is sequenced second (G09 Sequelae of inflammatory diseases of central nervous system). The code for the acute phase of an illness or injury that led to the late effect is never used with a code for the late effect. In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, look for Palsy/cerebral (congenital)/spastic/quadriplegic guiding you to code G80.0. Next look for Sequela/meningitis/other or unspecified cause, which directs the coder to G09. G09 contains an instructional note to code first the condition resulting from (sequela) of the inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### A patient is admitted to the hospital for chest pain and hematemesis. The provider’s diagnosis for the patient is perforated esophagus. What diagnosis code(s) should be reported?

- R07.9, K22.3
- ==K22.3==
- R07.9, K92.0
- K92.0

>**Rationale**: ICD-10-CM coding guideline I.B.5 states “Signs and symptoms that are associated with routinely with a disease process should not be assigned as additional codes, unless otherwise instructed by the classification.” In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, look for Perforation/esophagus, guiding you to code K22.3. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### When a patient has a condition that is both acute and chronic and there are separate entries for both, how is it reported?

- Code only the chronic code.
- ==Code both, sequencing the acute first.==
- Code only the acute code.
- Code both, sequencing the chronic first.

>**Rationale**: According to the ICD-10-CM guideline I.B.8, if the same condition is described as both acute (subacute) and chronic, and separate entries exist in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index at the same indentation level, code both and sequence the acute (subacute) first.

### What is the ICD-10-CM code for acute gastritis with bleeding?

- K29.00
- K29.61
- ==K29.01==
- K29.60

>**Rationale**: Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Gastritis/acute/with bleeding, which refers you to K29.01.Verify selection in the Tabular List

### What do brackets [] indicate in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index?

- ==Use the code(s) in brackets in addition to the disease or condition to identify an associated manifestation.==
- Do not assign the code in brackets.
- Use the code(s) in brackets as the only code.
- Use the code(s) in brackets first.

>**Rationale**: ICD-10-CM guideline I.A.7 states brackets used in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index identify manifestation codes.

### What is the ICD-10-CM code for septic shock?

- R65.21. A41.9
- ==A41.9, R65.21==
- R65.21
- R65.20

>**Rationale**: Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Shock/septic and you are directed to R65.21. ICD-10-CM guideline I.C.1.d.2 states to code the systemic infection (sepsis) first, followed by the code for septic shock. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### A patient is admitted to the hospital with influenza with pneumonia. The provider selected J18.9. Refer to the Tabular List to verify code J18.9. Is it correct to report code J18.9? Why?

- Yes, code J18.9 is a combination code assigned to influenza with pneumonia.
- No, the influenza code, J11.1, also needs to be reported on the claim.
- ==No, there is a combination code. J11.00 includes influenza with pneumonia.==
- Yes, because the provider selected J18.9, it must be reported.

>**Rationale**: In the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index, look for Influenza/with/pneumonia guiding you to code J11.00. ICD-10-CM guideline I.B.9, states “Assign only the combination code when that code fully identifies the diagnostic conditions involved or when the Alphabetical Index so directs.”

### When coding for a surgical procedure, how is the diagnosis determined?

- Z codes are always reported for surgery.
- Code the preoperative diagnosis because it is the most definitive.
- Code the preoperative diagnosis and postoperative diagnosis if the diagnoses are different.
- ==Code the postoperative diagnosis because it is the most definitive.==

>**Rationale**: If the postoperative diagnosis is different from the preoperative diagnosis at the time the diagnosis is confirmed, select the postoperative diagnosis for coding because it is the most definitive. Query the provider if a definitive diagnosis is not clear in the documentation.

### Which of the following statements is TRUE about reporting body mass index (BMI) codes?

- ==BMI codes are reported as secondary codes only.==
- BMI codes are only reported with the ICD-10-CM code E66.3 for overweight.
- BMI codes are never reported in ICD-10-CM.
- BMI codes are reported as primary codes only.

>**Rationale**: ICD-10-CM guideline I.B.14 indicates that BMI codes are reported as secondary diagnoses. In the Tabular List, BMI codes can be reported with any code in subcategory E66.-, not just code E66.3.

### A patient presents to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fever. The provider suspects appendicitis with perforation. The patient is admitted to the hospital for emergency surgery to remove the appendix. Surgical findings conclude the appendix had not ruptured; however, at the time of discharge the following day, pathology is still pending. The discharge diagnosis is suspected acute appendicitis without perforation. What ICD-10-CM code(s) is reported?

- K35.20
- ==K35.80==
- R11.2, R10.9, R50.9
- R11.2, R10.9, R50.9, K35.80

>**Rationale**: ICD-10-CM guideline 1.B.4 indicates codes that describe symptoms and signs, as opposed to diagnoses, are acceptable for reporting purposes when a provider has not established (confirmed) the diagnosis. Guideline II.H states if the diagnosis at the time of discharge from an inpatient admission is qualified as “suspected” it should be coded as if it existed. Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Appendicitis/acute, which directs you to K35.80. Verify code selection in the Tabular List.

### The word AND should be interpreted to mean ___ when it appears in a title.

- And – patient must have both
- ==“And” or “or” – patient may have either or both==
- Instead of
- Do not use

>**Rationale**: According to the ICD-10-CM guideline 1.A.14, the word AND should be interpreted to mean either “and” or “or” when it appears in an ICD-10-CM code description.

### What is the ICD-10-CM code for an initial encounter for a left anterior column fracture of the acetabulum?

- S32.402A
- S32.412A
- S32.431A
- ==S32.432A==

>**Rationale**: Look in the ICD-10-CM Alphabetic Index for Fracture/acetabulum/column/anterior, which directs the coder to S32.43-. In the Tabular List the 6 th character 2 is selected for the right wrist. This code also indicates a 7th character is required. A is selected for the initial encounter. The default for fractures not specified as closed or open is closed. The default for fractures not specified as displaced or nondisplaced is displaced.

### What does guideline I.C.19.e.5.b.2 discuss?
- Low birth weight and immaturity status
- Pressure ulcers documented as healing
- ==Overdose of a drug intentionally taken==
- Interaction of drugs and alcohol

>**Rationale**: Use the ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines Index to narrow down your search. Start with 1.C.19.e, which will direct you to which page of the guidelines to begin your search. From there, continue locating your subsections until you find the one titled “Overdose of a drug intentionally taken.”
