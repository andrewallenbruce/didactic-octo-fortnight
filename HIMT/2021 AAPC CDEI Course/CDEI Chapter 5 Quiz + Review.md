# Chapter 5
## **Inpatient Payment Systems**
### Hospital admissions can be classified into one of ___ MS-DRGs?
- 567
- 700
- ==767==
- 657

>**Rationale**: The prospective payment system used by Medicare and many other payers for inpatient payments is the Medicare Severity-Diagnostic Related Group (MS-DRG) system. In its current form, hospital admissions can be classified into one of 767 MS-DRGs.

### How are MS-DRGs assigned when a patient has more than one valid OR procedure performed during an inpatient admission?
- When a patient has more than one valid OR procedure performed during an inpatient admission, the MS-DRG that reflects the least resource-intensive surgical procedure will be assigned.
- ==When a patient has more than one valid OR procedure performed during an inpatient admission, the MS-DRG that reflects the most resource-intensive surgical procedure will be assigned.==
- Two MS-DRGs are assigned when a patient has more than one valid OR procedure performed during an inpatient admission.
- No MS-DRG will be assigned when a patient has more than one valid OR procedure performed during an inpatient admission.

>**Rationale**: There is a surgical hierarchy within each MDC. When a patient has more than one valid OR procedure performed during an inpatient admission, the MS-DRG that reflects the most resource-intensive surgical procedure will be assigned. For example, if a patient received both a D & C and a hysterectomy during the same admission, the patient would be assigned to the hysterectomy surgical group.

### CMS requires patient discharge status codes for which of the following?
- Outpatient psychiatric centers
- Physician offices
- Ambulatory surgical centers
- ==Hospital inpatient claims==

>**Rationale**: The patient’s discharge status disposition is assigned by a two-digit code to indicate the location where the patient is discharged at the end of their inpatient stay. CMS requires patient discharge status codes for hospital inpatient claims, skilled nursing claims, outpatient hospital services, hospice, and home health claims.

### What is the first step in assigning the correct MS-DRG?
- ==Assign all diagnostic codes==
- Assign discharge status code.
- Assign the principal diagnostic code
- Assign all procedural codes.

>**Rationale**: The first step in assigning an MS-DRG is to assign all diagnostic codes.

### CMS established which rule as a benchmark for physicians to use to determine patient status for inpatient or outpatient care?
- The Stark Rule
- ==Two-midnight Rule==
- The Benchmark Rule
- The Medical Necessity Rule

>**Rationale**: CMS established the two-midnight rule as a benchmark for physicians to use to determine patient status for inpatient or outpatient care. CMS specifies that when the physician expects the patient to require care crossing two midnights and orders admission based upon that expectation, inpatient status is generally appropriate.

### How many subclasses exist for each AP-DRG?
- Three
- ==Four==
- Two
- One

>**Rationale**: There are four subclasses for each DRG that relate to the severity of illness and risk of mortality.

### For this case you will determine the correct diagnosis codes, MS-DRG (with the table provided), and the payment rate. A 63-year-old patient, is admitted with aspiration pneumonia. On day two he decompensates further and is treated for acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The hospital base rate is $5,000.00.

1. What is the principal diagnosis? ==J69.0==
	1. MCC: ==J96.01==
2. What is the MS-DRG? ==177==
3. What is the payment rate? ==$9,226.50==

>**Rationale**: The principal diagnosis is the aspiration pneumonia as it conditioned the patient’s admission. 
>
>In the ICD-10-CM Index to Pneumonia, aspiration. We do not have further information so default code J69.0 is selected. 
>
>For the patient’s secondary diagnosis of acute respiratory failure look up Failure in the Alphabetic Index followed by acute/hypoxic and you are directed to J96.01. Verify all selections in the Tabular List. 
>
>There is one MCC documented: the acute respiratory failure J96.01. 
>
>The payment rate is determined by multiplying the RW x HBR 
>(1.8453 x $5,000 = $9,226.50).

### Classification into an MS-DRG  is based on which of the following?
- Age, gender, location, secondary diagnosis, and major procedures performed
- ==Age, gender complications, and major procedures performed==
- Age, gender, race,  complications and comorbidities
- Age, gender, relative weight, and major procedures performed

>**Rationale**: Age, gender, complications and comorbidities , and major procedures performed all play a role in determining the MS-DRG a patient is classified into.

### How is relative weight (RW) determined?
- ==The RW is determined by dividing the average costs of providing services to inpatients assigned to an MS-DRG by the average costs of providing services to all inpatients.==
- The RW is determined by dividing the costs of providing services all inpatients assigned to an MS-DRG by the costs of providing services to all outpatient.
- The RW is determined by subtracting the average costs of providing services to inpatients assigned to an MS-DRG from the average costs of providing services to all inpatients. 
- The RW is determined by multiplying the average costs of providing services to inpatients assigned to an MS-DRG by the average costs of providing services to all inpatients.
    
>**Rationale**: The RW is determined by dividing the average costs of providing services to inpatients assigned to an MS-DRG by the average costs of providing services to all inpatients.

### According to CMS, a “discharge” occurs when a Medicare beneficiary does the which of the following?
- Leaves the rehab facility
- Pays their full claim
- ==Dies in the hospital==
- Leaves an ambulatory facility
    
>**Rationale**: A “discharge” occurs when a Medicare beneficiary: 1. eaves a Medicare IPPS acute care hospital after receiving complete acute care treatment, or 2. Dies in the hospital.

### How many DRGs are affected by mechanical ventilation?
- 3
- 2
- 4
- ==5==
    
>**Rationale**: There are five DRGs that are affected by mechanical ventilation:

• 870 *Septicemia or severe sepsis with mv >96 hours*
• 871 *Septicemia or severe sepsis without mv >96 hours with mcc*
• 872 *Septicemia or severe sepsis without mv >96 hours without mcc*
• 927 *Extensive burns or full thickness burns with mv >96 hours with skin graft*
• 933 *Extensive burns or full thickness burns with mv >96 hours without skin graft*

### Which of the following programs requires quality data to be reported annually in order to receive  incentive payments:
- ==The Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) Program==
- The Hospital Value Incentive Program
- The Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program
- The Hospital Readmission Reduction Program
    
>**Rationale**: The Hospital IQR Program is a pay-for-reporting program established by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act.

### For this case you will determine the correct diagnosis code(s), procedure code(s), MS-DRG (with the table provided), and the payment rate. A 78-year-old female patient is admitted with a type II open fracture of her left hip as a result of a fall in the bathroom. She requires an ORIF of the hip. The patient has diabetes and CAD with unstable angina which are managed through the course of the admission. The hospital base rate is $3,500.00.

1. What are the diagnosis codes?
	1. ==S72.002B==
	2. ==E11.9==
	3. ==I25.110==
2. What is the procedure code? ==0QS704Z==
3. What is the MS-DRG? ==481==
4. What is the payment rate? ==$7,175.35==

>**Rationale**: A 78-year-old female patient is admitted for a type II open fracture of the left hip. In the ICD-10-CM Index to Diseases look up Fracture/hip and you are referred to see also Fracture, femur, neck. Look up Fracture/femur/neck and you are referred to see Fracture, femur, upper end, neck. You are referred to S72.00. The sixth character is 2 for the left hip. The seventh character extender is B for an open fracture. The patient is treated for her chronic condition, which is diabetes and CAD with unstable angina. The type of diabetes is not documented so the default is type II and there is no indication of a manifestation. It is reported with E11.9. The patient has CAD with unstable angina. In the Table of Drugs look up arteriosclerosis/coronary/native vessel/with angina pectoris/unstable and you are directed to I25.110.Verify all codes in the Tabular List. Since a hip procedure was done, the choices for MS-DRG are 480, 481, and 482. E11.9, is not listed on the Table 6I MCC or Table 6J CC. I25.110 is listed as a CC. Therefore the MS-DRG is 481. The patient had an open reduction and internal fixation performed. A secondary diagnosis was on the CC list. The payment rate is determined by multiplying the RW x HBR (2.0501 x $3,500 = $7,175.35.20).

### All are reasons payments can be adjusted in the IPPS package EXCEPT?
- ==Low percentage of high income patients==
- Hospital’s teaching status
- Extremely costly inpatient cases
- Differences in geographic area wages
 
>**Rationale**: Payments can be adjusted for many reasons including differences in geographic area wages, in certain cases the hospital’s teaching status, or if the hospital has a high percentage of low-income patients, as well as the use of new technology and extremely costly inpatient cases.

### Software programs that take information from inpatient claim forms in order to determine the proper MS-DRG are called what?
- Medicare resource groupers
- Medicare calculator
- ==Medicare groupers==
- Medicare PRICER

>**Rationale**: Medicare groupers are software programs that take information from inpatient claim forms — including ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, ICD-10-PCS codes for surgical procedures performed during the hospitalization, and patient demographics — and use that information to determine the proper MS-DRG for the hospital admission. Hospital medical records must be accurate and complete to help ensure the software assigns the correct MS-DRG to the admission.

### Which reimbursement methodology is utilized in the skilled nursing facility setting?
- Case-Mix Groups (CMGs)
- Skilled Nursing Facility Payment Model
- Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups (MS-DRG)
- ==Patient Driven Payment Model==

>**Rationale**: Skilled nursing facilities use the Patient Driven Payment Model to receive a per diem rate.

### The Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) applies to which of the following?
- Doctor’s offices
- Ambulatory surgical centers
- Rehab hospitals
- ==Skilled nursing facilities==

>**Rationale**: Hospitals, SNFs, home health, and hospice providers are contracted with Medicare to provide acute inpatient care.

### Each Medicare patient is classified into an MS-DRG according to what?
- Relative weight
- ==Principal diagnosis==
- Medicare/Medicaid eligibility
- Principal procedure

>**Rationale**: MS-DRGs are determined by the patient’s complications and comorbidities, surgical procedures, age, gender, and discharge destination.

### What is the formula for computing the hospital payment for each MS-DRG?
- ==RW x HBR = Hospital payment==
- RW x CMI = Hospital payment
- RW - CMI = Hospital payment
- RW / HBR = Hospital payment

>**Rationale**: Payment for each MS-DRG is calculated by multiplying the MS-DRG RW by the hospital base rate (HBR). The HBR is adjusted annually and includes factors to account for average capital costs and operating expenses, as well as individualized factors to account for local wage variations, teaching hospitals costs, and hospitals with a disproportionate share of indigent patients.

### Identify which of the following acts was signed into law in 2010 and is also known as the 72-hour rule?
- ==The Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act (PACMBPRA)==
- The Social Security Act (SSA)
- The Medicare Act (TMA)
- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

>**Rationale**: The Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act (PACMBPRA) was signed into law in 2010. This act established what is often referred to as the 72-hour (or three-day) rule. It defined the elements that must be included on a beneficiary’s inpatient claim including diagnosis, procedures, and charges for all outpatient diagnostic services and outpatient non-diagnostic services relating to the admission furnished to the beneficiary during the three-day payment window.

### For this case you will determine the correct diagnosis codes, MS-DRG (with the table provided), and the payment rate. A 77-year-old male patient is admitted with an acute COPD exacerbation. The patient has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type II diabetes. The hospital base rate is $5,500.00. 

| MS-DRG | Description                                                 | MDC | Description                                      | Type | GMLOS | AMLOS | RW     | FR PA DRG | FR SP DRG |

The secondary diagnoses are not on the MCC or CC list. The payment rate is determined by multiplying the RW x HBR.

1. What are the diagnosis codes?
	1. ==J44.1==
	2. ==E11.9==
	3. ==I10==
	4. ==E78.5==
2. What is the MS-DRG? ==192==
3. What is the payment rate? ==$3.995.75==

>**Rationale**: The principal diagnosis is COPD with acute exacerbation. In the ICD-10-CM Index to Diseases, look up Bronchitis/acute/with exacerbation. The correct code is J44.1. The patient is also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, which is reported with E11.9. The patient also has hypertension (I10) and hyperlipidemia (E78.5). The secondary diagnoses are not on the MCC or CC list. The payment rate is determined by multiplying the RW x HBR (0.7265 x $5,500 = $3,995.75).

### Which statement is TRUE regarding APR-DRGs?
- They can be used to increase the relative weight (RW).
- They can be used to increase the hospital payment rate (HPR).
- ==They can be used as a part of quality improvement for utilization control.==
- They can be used to control hospital acquired conditions (HAC).

>**Rationale**: APR-DRGs are used by many states for their Medicaid population and by university and teaching hospitals throughout the U.S.
>
• They can be used as part of a quality improvement program for utilization control.
>
• They can be used for reimbursement in a prospective payment system.
>
• They can be used to rank hospitals in risk of mortality.
>
• They can also be used to review mortality cases retrospectively to examine the relationship between the patient’s illness and ROM score to look for potential opportunities for improvement in patient care.

### Which of the following MDCs are NOT based on the principal diagnosis?
- MDC 23
- MDC 12
- ==MDC 99==
- MDC 1 - MDC 23

>**Rationale**: MDCs 1-23 are based on the principal diagnosis.

### Which of the following programs adjust payments to hospitals for inpatient services based on their performance on an announced set of measures.
- The Hospital Readmission Reduction Program
- ==Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program==
- The Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) Program
- The Hospital Value Incentive Program

>**Rationale**: Established by the Affordable Care Act, the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program adjusts payments to hospitals for inpatient services based on their performance on an announced set of measures.

### Medicare defines medical necessity as services that are meet which of the following?
- Not excluded under the 72-hour rule
- The most cost effective
- ==Reasonable and necessary==
- Approved by local determination

>**Rationale**: Medicare defines medical necessity as service that are:
	>Reasonable and necessary
	>For the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury or to improve the function of a malformed body member and
	>Not excluded under another provision of the Medicare program.

### Which of the following is Medicare’s definition of medical necessity?
- ==Reasonable and necessary; for diagnosis and treatment illness or injury; and not excluded under another provision of the Medicare program.==
- Cost-effective; requires intervention or treatment; and must be part of another provision of the Medicare program.
- Care must be provided within 72 hours of the claim; care required may be emergent or non-emergent; and patient must be admitted as an inpatient.
- Care will be provided as an inpatient; patient must be admitted for a minimum of two midnights; and care required is emergent or non-emergent.

>**Rationale**: The Medicare glossary defines medical necessity as “services that are reasonable and necessary; for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member; and not excluded under another provision of the Medicare program.”

### A hospital acquired condition (HAC) is best described as:
- An event occurring within 30 days after discharge
- A condition present on admission to the hospital
- Reported to CMS at the discretion of the facility
- ==Associated with reimbursement penalties==

>**Rationale**: CMS implemented a 1 percent penalty for hospitals in the top 25th percentile for HACs (e.g., worst performing hospitals in these quality measures). HAC measure scores are calculated to assess the HAC incentive penalty.

### Which of the following statements is true regarding the Two-Midnight rule?
- This rule pertains to private insurance only.
- This rule refers to payment timeframe for outpatient services.
- ==This rule determines patient status for inpatient or outpatient care.==
- This rule pertains solely admissions involving transfer to another facility.

>**Rationale**: CMS established the Two-Midnight rule as a benchmark for physicians to use to determine patient status for inpatient or outpatient care. CMS specifies that when the physician expects the patient to require care crossing two midnights and orders admission based upon that expectation, inpatient status is generally appropriate. Conversely, CMS specifies that hospital stays in which the physician expects the patient to require care for less than two midnights are considered outpatient care, as inpatient status would generally be inappropriate.

### Which of the following statements regarding Diagnostic Related Groups (DRGs) is true?
- ==DRGs represent the minimum resources needed to treat patients that fall in the same DRG compared to the national average of resources needed to treat all Medicare patients.==
- The RW is determined by multiplying the average costs of providing services to inpatients assigned to a MS-DRG by the average costs of providing services to all inpatients.
- The case-mix index (CMI) is the average of the sum of the RWs of all patients treated within that state.
- If a hospital can treat a patient for a condition at a cost that is less than the Medicare reimbursement amount, the hospital will return the excess amount.

>**Rationale**: DRGs represent the minimum resources needed to treat patients that fall in the same DRG compared to the national average of resources needed to treat all Medicare patients.

### Which of the following does NOT use the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS)?
- ==Children’s hospitals==
- Skilled nursing facility (SNF)
- Hospice
- Home health agency

>**Rationale**:  The Medicare IPPS applies to most acute care hospitals. It is not used to calculate payments for psychiatric

### Which of the following answers defines what a principal diagnosis is?
- The DRG assignment confirmed after coding of the patient record.
- The reason the patient came to the emergency department for treatment.
- The principal diagnosis is used to determine if the patient has an MCC.
- ==The condition responsible for the admission of the patient to the hospital.==

>**Rationale**: The principal diagnosis is defined as “that condition established after study to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of the patient to the hospital for care.” (Official Coding Guideline Section II)

### Which of the following answers regarding Medicare Groupers is false?
- Medicare Groupers use patient demographic data for MS-DRG assignment.
- ==Medicare Groupers focus on adult populations.==
- Medicare Groupers use ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes.
- Medicare Groupers use ICD-10-PCS surgical codes.

>**Rationale**: Medicare Groupers are software programs that take information from inpatient claim forms — including ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, ICD-10-PCS codes for surgical procedures performed during the hospitalization, and patient demographics — and use that information to determine the proper MS-DRG for the hospital admission.

### Regarding APR-DRGs, the severity of illness (SOI) and risk of mortality (ROM) are classified as which of the following?
- Class A, Class B, Class C, and Class D
- 1st degree, 2nd degree, 3rd degree, 4th degree
- ==Minor, moderate, major, extreme==
- Insignificant, significant, critical, fatal

>**Rationale**:  The four subclasses for severity of illness and risk of mortality are numbered from 1 to 4 and represent categories minor, moderate, major, and extreme.

### Which of the following is NOT a benefit of using APR-DRGs?
- They can be used to review mortality cases retrospectively to look for potential opportunities for improvement in patient care.
- They can be used as part of a quality improvement program for utilization control.
- They can be used to rank hospitals in risk of mortality.
- ==They can be used for inpatient and outpatient DRG assignment.==

>**Rationale**: APR-DRGs are specific to inpatient stays and care.

 ### The Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act (PACMBPRA) was signed into law in 2010. Which of the following was established as a result?
- Two-Midnight rule
- ==72-hour rule==
- Standardized payment rates
- Hospital Readmission Reduction Program

>**Rationale**: The Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act (PACMBPRA) was signed into law in 2010. This act established what is often referred to as the 72-hour (or three-day) rule. It defined the elements that must be included on a beneficiary’s inpatient claim including diagnosis, procedures, and charges for all outpatient diagnostic services and outpatient non-diagnostic services relating to the admission furnished to the beneficiary during the three-day payment window.

### Case 1 IMPRESSION/PLAN:
1. Questionable presyncope. She was admitted to telemetry late last night.
2. Osteoporosis.
3. Hypertension with elevated blood pressures. Overnight, she did receive some IV Lopressor and is holding the p.o. Lopressor this morning. Will continue to watch this throughout the day. Perhaps, if her blood pressures have been running a little high that may have made her feel a little strange as well. Will keep an eye on it.
4. History of transient ischemic attack and cerebrovascular accident.
5. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

#### Select the diagnosis code(s):
- ==R55, M81.0, I10, K21.9, Z86.73==
- R55, M81.0, I16.9, K21.9
- R40.20, M81.0, I10, K21.9, Z86.73
- R40.20, M81.0, I16.0, K21.9
 
 #### Use the Table above and the MCC and CC list on the CMS website to determine the correct MS-DRG:
- 224
- 225
- 287
- ==312==

#### What is the hospital payment rate for the patient in Case 2 for a facility with a hospital base rate of $3,201?
- $23,566.40
- $18,011.38
- $3,681.15
- ==$2,679.87==

>**Rationale**: The patient present with questionable presyncope.

>Presyncope is the principal diagnosis. From the ICD-10-CM Index, look up Presyncope you are referred to R55. The patient is also diagnosed with osteoporosis (M81.0), hypertension (I10), GERD (K21.9) and history of TIA and CVA (Z86.73).

>Using the table, the options for R55 as a principal diagnosis are provided. The secondary diagnoses are not on the MCC or CC list. The MS-DRG is 312.

>The hospital payment rate is the RW x base which is 0.83.72 x $3,201= $2,679.87.

### What is the most effective way to improve the accuracy of a facilities CMI?
- Increasing cost of care
- Denying payment for conditions that are POA
- Treating severely sick patients only
- ==Improving documentation==

>**Rationale**: The most effectual way to improve the accuracy of a facilities CMI an is through documentation. Physician documentation must paint the picture of the care they are providing to their patients. The documentation should be clear, concise, complete, timely, legible, and consistent.
