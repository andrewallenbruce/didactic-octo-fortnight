>**Rationale:** Specific details of the surgery are described in the body of the note. The details in this area will determine the ICD-10-PCS code(s) used to convey the surgical services performed.
			   
### Medical records must be retained in which of the following formats?
- Electronically
- Paper format
- Microfiche
- ==A specific requirement does not exist==
 
>**Rationale:** There are no specific requirements as to how the medical records must be retained. They may be kept in their original format or reproduced in a way that is legally acceptable.

Some examples include [[Health Maintenance Organization|health maintenance organizations]] ([[Health Maintenance Organization|HMOs]]), [[Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], and [[Medicare]] supplement insurers, as well as employer, government, and church-sponsored [[group health plans]]. An exception is an employer who solely establishes and maintains the plan with fewer than 50 participants and is exempt. Two types of government-funded programs are not health plans. These are food stamps and community health centers. Insurers providing only workers’ compensation, automobile insurance, and property and casualty insurance are not considered to be health plans.

- Release of information
- ==Informed consent==
 
>**Rationale:** Prior to a patient undergoing a specific medical intervention, state law requires that the provider obtain an informed consent for treatment. This form is signed by the patient to verify that the patient understands procedures, outcomes, and options.

### In which section of an operative report would you expect to find the reason or [[medical necessity]] for the procedure?
- ==Indication for surgery==
- Body of the operative report
- Pathology report
- Postoperative findings
 
>**Rationale:** The indication typically gives a brief history outlining the reasons for or [[medical necessity]] for the procedure.
 
### Which of the following circumstances allows providers to use or disclose [[protected health information]] without patient consent?
- Advertising of the entity’s services
- ==Payment, treatment, or operations==
- Request from a spouse or another family member

- The contract can remain, but each patient should be notified of the breach.
- OIG and the HHS Office for Civil Rights must be notified.
 
>**Rationale:** If a covered entity identifies a material breach or violation of the contract or agreement, reasonable steps must be taken to cure the breach or end the violation. If that is not possible, the contract must be terminated, and the problem reported to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR).
 
### In the absence of clearly defined laws and regulations relating to the content of a medical record, healthcare institutions must do which of the following?
- ==Establish their own standards==

### When using templates to document in a medical record, what documentation must be included in the template?
- All check boxes must be complete whether normal or abnormal.
- ==Elaboration on abnormal findings.==
- The patient’s height and/or weight to verify there was a face-to-face visit.
- A family history of relevant diseases.
 
>**Rationale:** When providers use templates for documentation, they might have check boxes to indicate whether an exam of a body area or organ system is normal. In this case, any findings that are abnormal must have elaboration as to what is abnormal. It is helpful if the provider has a key explaining checklist symbols.

 ### How many national priority purposes permit the use and disclosure of protecting health information without an individual’s authorization or permission?
- 7
- 20
- ==12==
- 3

>**Rationale:** The Privacy Rule identified 12 national priorities for disclosure of information without an individual’s authorization or permission through public interest and benefit activities.
			
### Under transmission standards of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, the patient record must be protected from unauthorized disclosure and interception. How is this accomplished?
- Allowing only physicians to have access to patient medical records through a secure website.
- ==Establishing policies and safeguards governing the gathering, storing, use, and disclosure of identifiable patient information when using electronic transmission.==
- Establishing a records request hotline that is only accessible by physicians.
- Establishing policies and procedures for each written medical records request received verifying that only a physician is requesting the records.

>**Rationale:** The collection and storage of healthcare information must meet the minimum documentation requirements. HIPAA requires covered entities and business associates to use appropriate safeguards and comply with Subpart C of 45 CFR Part 164 with respect to electronic protected health information, to prevent use or disclosure of protected health information other than as provided for by the set agreement. 
			
 ### What is the definition of minimum necessary?

- ==Covered entities take reasonable steps to limit the use or disclosure of, and requests for, protected health information.==
- Information that includes the individual’s past, present or future physical or mental health condition.

>**Rationale:** The minimum necessary standard is a key protection of HIPAA Privacy Rule. The Privacy Rule requires covered entities to take reasonable steps to limit the use or disclosure of, and requests for, protected health information to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. A covered entity is required to develop and implement policies and procedures to reasonable limit uses and disclosures to the minimum necessary.
			
### Which of organization is responsible for administering and enforcing standards within the Privacy Rule?
- Department of Justice
- ==Office of Civil Rights==
- Office of Inspector General
- National Institutes of Health

>**Rationale:** HHS, Office of Civil Rights (OCR) is responsible for administering and enforcing the standards set forth in the Privacy Rule and may conduct complaint investigations and compliance reviews. Covered entities failing to comply and cooperate with any investigation initiated by OCR may be subject to civil monetary penalties.
			
 ### What is NOT the purpose of the documentation for patient’s services?
- Reimbursement
- ==Provider’s record==
- Clinical research
- Quality of care

>**Rationale:** In addition to providing a health history of the patient’s services, the documentation of services is used for the purposes of reimbursement, [[medical necessity]] support, quality of care, clinical research, and outcome management. 
			
### What is the name of the official business record created by a healthcare organization that will be disclosed if requested by parties outside of the organization?
- Conditions of coverage

- Services that are defined in the [[Conditions of Participation]] (CoP)/Conditions for Coverage (CfC)
- Services listed in the [[Medicare]] Coverage Issues Manual that are consistent with the diagnosis of the patient

>**Rationale:** Payers define [[medical necessity]] as services or supplies that are in accordance with standards of good medical practice, consistent with diagnosis, and appropriate level of care provided in the most appropriate setting. 
			
### Which of the following is NOT a risk when providers use templates for documentation?
- Upcoding
- Over documentation not supporting [[medical necessity]]
- ==Undercoding==
- Cloning

>**Rationale:** EHRs often have built-in templates that might cause a provider to document more than is medically necessary for that visit. This can cause upcoding as well. Templates assist in full and complete collection of information but also allow for customization to fit the patient and the condition, if careful attention is not paid cloning can result.
			
### Which of following organizations is the most known accrediting organization for hospitals?
- Institute for Medical Quality
- ==The Joint Commission==
- Community Health Accreditation Partner
- The Compliance Team

>**Rationale:** The JC is one of the most known accrediting organizations. 
			
### How long should the medical record be retained according to the [[CMS]]?
- Three years
- ==Five years==
