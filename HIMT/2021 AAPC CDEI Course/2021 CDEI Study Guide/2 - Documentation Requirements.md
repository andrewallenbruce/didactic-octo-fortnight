# Documentation Requirements
## Introduction
The medical record is chronological documentation of a patient’s medical history and care. Entries in the medical record are made by all types of providers who provide healthcare services to a patient, and include identification information, a patient’s health history, medical examination documentation and findings, and results of various tests, such as lab and X-ray, among other information.

Hospital accreditation and regulatory standards set forth by federal and state governments require that a separate healthcare record exist for individual patients. The collection and storage of healthcare information must meet the minimum documentation requirements to ensure the record provides a complete chronology of the patient services allowing for the continuity of patient care among providers.

The medical record is a multipurpose instrument. In addition to providing a health history of the patient’s services, the documentation of services is used for the purposes of reimbursement, [[medical necessity]] support, quality of care, clinical research, and outcome management.

Due to the vast amount of private information in a medical record, and the different ways in which a medical record can be used (such as, medicolegal), there are many rules and regulations regarding the privacy of, sharing of, and required documentation in the medical record. This chapter will discuss the [[HIPAA|Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996]] (HIPAA) and its effect on the medical record, legal requirements for medical records, and basic structure and components of the medical record.

## Ownership and Access of the Medical Record
The medical record is the property of the hospital, and they are responsible for creating the record; however, the information contained in the record belongs to the individual patient. The facility must maintain control of the record to ensure accuracy and maintain the patient’s privacy.

The Institute of Medicine (IoM) defines the users of the health record as “those individuals who enter, verify, correct, analyze, or obtain information from the record either directly or indirectly.” The main users of the health record are the clinicians who are responsible for direct patient care. These clinicians are authorized to record and access clinical documentation for the patients to whom they provide services. Clinicians should only access medical records of their own patients. Accessing other patient records or disclosing information found in the healthcare record without valid reason is considered a HIPAA violation.

## Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
HIPAA was enacted on August 21, 1996. HIPAA, also known as the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, was originally enacted to provide rights and protections for participants and beneficiaries of [[group health plans]]. Under this law, exclusions for pre-existing conditions were limited, and discrimination against employees and dependents based on their health status were prohibited. HIPAA also established the Healthcare [[Fraud]] and [[Abuse]] Control Program, a far-reaching program to combat fraud and abuse in healthcare, including both public and private health plans.

HIPAA Administrative Simplification provisions required that sections of the law be publicized to explain the standards for the electronic exchange, privacy, and security of health information. Congress did not enact privacy legislation within the specified time governed by HIPAA. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) developed a proposed rule, which was released for comment on November 3, 1999. Many comments were received, and modifications were made to the rule. The modifications were published and released in final form on August 14, 2002.

### Privacy Rule
HHS issued a privacy rule to set a national standard for the protection of certain health information. The Privacy Rule standards address how an individual’s [[protected health information]] (PHI) may be used. Its purpose is to protect individual privacy, while promoting high quality healthcare and public health and well-being. The Privacy Rule was designed to be flexible and comprehensive, and allow for the various uses and disclosures the healthcare community must address.

All covered entities are required to follow the Privacy Rule. Covered entities are defined as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and any healthcare provider who transmits health information in an electronic format.

>**Health plan** covered entities are organizations that pay providers on behalf of an individual receiving medical care. These plans include health, dental, vision, and prescription drug insurers. Some examples include [[Health Maintenance Organization|health maintenance organizations]] (HMOs), Medicare, [[Medicaid]], and [[Medicare]] supplement insurers, as well as employer, government, and church-sponsored group health plans. There are exceptions: An employer who solely establishes and maintains the plan with fewer than 50 participants is exempt. Two types of government-funded programs are not health plans: food stamps and community health centers. Insurers providing only workers’ compensation, automobile insurance, and property and casualty insurance are not considered to be health plans. 

>**All healthcare providers** who electronically transmit health information through certain transactions are covered entities. Some examples of transactions that may be submitted electronically are claim forms, inquiries about eligibility of benefits, and requests for authorization of referrals. Simply using electronic technology, such as sending emails, does not mean a healthcare provider is a [[covered entity]]; the transmission must be in connection with a standard transaction. The rule applies to all healthcare providers, regardless of whether they transmit the transactions directly, or use a billing service or other third party to transmit on their behalf. Healthcare providers are defined as providers of services, such as hospitals, and providers of medical or health services, such as physicians, dentists, and other practitioners who furnish, bill, or receive payment for healthcare. 

>**Healthcare clearinghouses** include billing services, re-pricing companies, and community health management information systems that process nonstandard information, received from another entity, into a standard (i.e., standard format or data content) or vice versa. In most instances, healthcare clearinghouses receive individually identifiable information for processing services to a health plan or healthcare provider as a business associate. In these cases, only certain provisions are applicable to the clearinghouses’ uses and disclosures of protected health information.

Transactions occur through electronic exchanges, which allow information to be transferred between two parties for specific purposes. A healthcare provider will send a claim to a health plan to request payment for the medical services they provide. HIPAA regulations standardized transactions for [[Electronic Data Interchange]] (EDI) of healthcare data. These transactions are claims and encounter information, payment and remittance advice, claims status, eligibility, enrollment and disenrollment, referrals and authorizations, coordination of benefits, and premium payment.

Under HIPAA, electronic transactions must use the adopted standard and adhere to the content and format requirements of ASC X12N or NCPDP (used for certain pharmacy transactions) for each transaction. An additional rule was adopted to standardize the code sets for diagnoses and procedures. These code sets include [[HCPCS Level II|HCPCS]] (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System—ancillary services and procedures); [[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]]® (Current Procedural Terminology—physicians’ procedures); CDT® (Current Dental Terminology—dental procedures); ICD-9 (International Classification of Diseases-9th revision—diagnosis and inpatient hospital procedures); ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision, which replaced ICD-9 on October 1, 2015); and NDC (National Drug Codes). In addition to the standardization of the codes used to request payment for medical services, a unique identifier for employers and providers must be used on all transactions.

Business associates perform certain functions or activities, which involve the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, on behalf of another person or organization, without being a member of the entity’s workforce. These services include claims processing or administration, data analysis, utilization review, billing, benefit management, and re-pricing. Business associate services to a [[covered entity]] are limited to legal, actuarial, accounting, consulting, data aggregation, management, administrative, accreditation, or financial services. To be considered a business associate, the persons or organizations would involve the use or disclosure of [[protected health information]] between the two parties. A covered entity can be a business associate of another covered entity. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, also specifies that an organization that provides data transmission of PHI to a covered entity and that requires access to PHI routinely, such as a Health Information Exchange Organization, will be treated as a business associate.

A contract is required between business associates to impose specified written safeguards on the individually identifiable health information used or disclosed by the business associate. The contract must describe the permitted and required uses of protected health information by the business associate, limit the business associate from using or further disclosing the protected health information (except where permitted by contract or required by law), and require the business associate to follow appropriate safeguards to prevent use or disclosure of the protected health information, except as expressly defined in the contract. Covered entities may not contractually authorize a business associate to make any use or disclosure of protected health information that would violate the Privacy Rule.

(b) Termination for Cause. Business associate authorizes termination of this Agreement by covered entity, if covered entity determines business associate has violated a material term of the Agreement [and business associate has not cured the breach or ended the violation within the time specified by covered entity]. [Bracketed language may be added if the covered entity wishes to provide the business associate with an opportunity to cure a violation or breach of the contract before termination for cause.]

(c) Obligations of Business Associate Upon Termination.
[Option 1—if the business associate is to return or destroy all protected health information upon termination of the agreement.]
Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, business associate shall return to covered entity [or, if agreed to by covered entity, destroy] all protected health information received from covered entity, or created, maintained, or received by business associate on behalf of covered entity, that the business associate still maintains in any form. Business associate shall retain no copies of the protected health information.

[Option 2—if the agreement authorizes the business associate to use or disclose protected health information for its own management and administration or to carry out its legal responsibilities and the business associate needs to retain protected health information for such purposes after termination of the agreement.]
Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, business associate, with respect to protected health information received from covered entity, or created, maintained, or received by business associate on behalf of covered entity, shall:

1. Retain only that protected health information which is necessary for business associate to continue its proper management and administration or to carry out its legal responsibilities;
2. Return to covered entity [or, if agreed to by covered entity, destroy] the remaining protected health information that the business associate still maintains in any form;
3. Continue to use appropriate safeguards and comply with Subpart C of 45 CFR Part 164 with respect to electronic protected health information to prevent use or disclosure of the protected health information, other than as provided for in this Section, for as long as business associate retains the protected health information;
4. Not use or disclose the protected health information retained by business associate other than for the purposes for which such protected health information was retained and subject to the same conditions set out at [Insert section number related to paragraphs (e) and (f) above under “Permitted Uses and Disclosures by Business Associate”] which applied prior to termination; and
5. Return to covered entity [or, if agreed to by covered entity, destroy] the protected health information retained by business associate when it is no longer needed by business associate for its proper management and administration or to carry out its legal responsibilities.

>[The agreement also could provide that the business associate will transmit the protected health information to another business associate of the covered entity at termination, and/or could add terms regarding a business associate’s obligations to obtain or ensure the destruction of protected health information created, received, or maintained by subcontractors.]

(d) Survival. The obligations of business associate under this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

>**Miscellaneous [Optional]**
(a) [Optional] Regulatory References. A reference in this Agreement to a section in the HIPAA Rules means the section as in effect or as amended.
```

If a covered entity identifies a material breach or violation of the contract or agreement, reasonable steps must be taken to cure the breach or end the violation. If that is not possible, the contract must be terminated, and the problem reported to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR).

>The Privacy Rule includes exceptions to the business associate standard, which do not require a covered entity to have a written agreement in place prior to disclosing protected health information. Examples include:
>
- Disclosures by a covered entity to a healthcare provider for treatment of the individual, such as:
	- A hospital referring a patient to a specialist and transmitting the patient’s medical chart for treatment purposes
	- A physician sending specimens to a lab for analysis 
	- A hospital lab sending specimens to a reference lab for analysis
- Disclosures to a health plan sponsor, such as an employer, by a group health plan that provides the health insurance benefits or coverage for the group health plan. 
- The collection and sharing of protected health information by a health plan that is a public benefits program, such as [[Medicare]]. 

Protected health information is “individually identifiable health information.” It includes many common identifiers, such as demographic data, name, address, birth date, and Social Security number. It also includes information that relates to an individual’s past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition; the provision of healthcare to the individual; or, the past, present, or future payment for the provision of healthcare to the individual, which reasonably may be used to identify an individual.

There are no restrictions on the use of de-identified health information. This type of information may be used for multiple purposes because when the protected health information is removed, a reasonable basis does not exist to identify an individual.

A covered entity may not use or disclose protected health information unless the Privacy Rule permits it or as the individual authorizes in writing. The Privacy Rule requires that a covered entity must disclose protected health information to an individual when they request their own information, or to HHS when it is investigating for compliance, review, or enforcement action.

>Permitted uses and disclosures of protected health information allow a covered entity to use and disclose certain information without an individual’s authorization in the following situations:
>
1. To the individual who is the subject of the information.
>
2. Protected health information may be used by a covered entity for treatment, payment, and healthcare operation activities.
>
3. The individual may grant informal permission by being asked outright, giving them the opportunity to agree or object in circumstances where the individual is not capable of providing his or her signature. Covered entities are expected to use their judgment in situations where the patient is incapacitated, or the covered entity is not available to provide the care that is in the best interest of the patient.
>
4. Incidental use and disclosure is permitted, as long as the covered entity has reasonable safeguards in place to ensure that the information being shared is limited to the “minimum necessary,” as required by the Privacy Rule.

```ad-Law
title: MINIMUM NECESSARY
The minimum necessary standard is a key protection of HIPAA Privacy Rule. The **Privacy Rule** requires covered entities to take reasonable steps to limit the use or disclosure of, and requests for, protected health information to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. A covered entity is required to develop and implement policies and procedures to reasonable limit uses and disclosures to the minimum necessary.

When the minimum necessary standard applies to a use or disclosure, a covered entity may not use, disclose, or request the entire medical record for a particular purpose, unless it can specifically justify the whole record as the amount reasonably needed for that purpose.
```

To strike a balance between the individual interest and public interest for specific protected health information, the Privacy Rule permits use and disclosure of this information without an individual’s authorization or permission through public interest and benefit activities. 

- > ### There are 12 national priority purposes:
	1. Required by law
	2. Public health activities
	3. Victims of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence
	4. Health oversight activities
	5. Judicial and administrative proceedings
	6. Law enforcement purposes
	7. Decedents (funeral directors or medical examiners)
	8. Cadaveric organ, eye, or tissue donation
	9. Research
	10. Serious threat to health or safety
	11. Essential government functions
	12. Workers’ compensation

A limited data set is protected health information from which certain specified direct identifiers have been removed. Limited data sets may be used for research, healthcare operations, and public health purposes, as long as there is an agreement with promised safeguards in place for the protected health information.

A privacy practice notice must be provided by each covered entity and must contain certain elements to notify individuals as to how the covered entity will use and disclose the individual’s protected health information. The notice must clearly explain the covered entity’s obligation to protect privacy, provide a notice of privacy practices, and abide by the terms of the current notice. The covered entity must also inform the patient of their individual rights, and the steps to follow (including a point of contact for further information) if an individual feels their privacy rights have been violated.

Beginning April 14, 2003, HHS said a distribution of the privacy notice must be provided to individuals promptly when there is a direct treatment relationship with the individual and a covered healthcare provider. The rule indicates the notice must be provided:
			
- Not later than the first service encounter by personal delivery of patient services, electronically or through mail;
- By posting the notice in a clear and prominent place that can be easily seen by people seeking services; and
- In emergent situations, the notice must be furnished when the emergency has abated.

Covered entities are also required to supply a notice to anyone upon request whether direct or indirect treatment was provided. In addition, covered entities must also make their privacy notices available electronically on any website maintained for customer service or benefits information.

Health plans are required to distribute their privacy policy notices upon new member enrollment. They are also required to send a reminder to their enrollees every three years, letting the enrollees know that the notice is available upon request. The requirement does indicate the health plan is only obligated to send the information to the “named insurer” (subscriber for coverage).

The rule indicates a healthcare provider must make a good faith effort to obtain written acknowledgement from patients that the patients have received the privacy practices notice. It does not outline specific content requirements; however, most covered entities ask for signatures from individuals, indicating the individual was provided a copy of the notice. Receipt of acknowledgement is relieved in emergent situations.

In most cases, individuals have the right to review and obtain copies of their protected health information; however, there are exceptions to the type of information that may be released. Areas excluded from the rights of access are psychotherapy notes, information related to legal proceedings, and certain lab results or information held by research laboratories. Covered entities may charge a reasonable fee for providing such information.

>HHS has created administrative requirements for covered entities. They realize that the size of covered entities can vary greatly; there is some flexibility and scalability built into the rule to allow analysis of each entity’s needs, and to implement the required rules appropriately. The administrative requirements that must be followed are:
>
- All covered entities must have written privacy policies that comply with the Privacy Rule.
	>
- A privacy official must be designated to be responsible for developing and implementing privacy policies and procedures and be the contact person for individuals with questions or concerns regarding the privacy practices.
	>
- All members of a covered entity’s workforce (employees, volunteers, and trainees) must be trained on the covered entity’s privacy policies. Appropriate sanctions must be applied to a workforce member who violates any area of the privacy rules.
	>
- Covered entities are required to mitigate any harmful effect that may have been caused by inappropriate use or disclosure of protected health information that was caused by its workforce or business associates.
	>
- Procedures must be in place to allow an individual to complain about a covered entity’s compliance with their privacy policies. 
	>
- A covered entity may not retaliate against a person for exercising their rights provided by the Privacy Rule or require an individual to waive any right to obtain healthcare services. 
	>
- Privacy policies must be maintained by covered entities for six years, after the later of the date of their creation, or last effective date. 
	>
- Fully insured [[group health plans]] have only two obligations: (1) banned from retaliatory acts and waiver of individual rights, and (2) to provide documentation for the disclosure of protected health information through documentation. 

HHS, Office of Civil Rights (OCR) is responsible for administering and enforcing the standards set forth in the Privacy Rule and may conduct complaint investigations and compliance reviews. Covered entities failing to comply and cooperate with any investigation initiated by OCR may be subject to civil monetary penalties. The penalties will vary significantly, depending on factors ranging from the date of the violation, whether the covered entity knew or should have known of the failure to comply, or whether the failure was due to willful neglect. Penalties may not exceed a calendar year cap for multiple violations of the same requirement.

For violations occurring prior to 2/18/2009, the penalty amount is up to $100 per violation, with a calendar year cap of $25,000. For violations occurring on or after 2/18/2009, the penalty amount ranges from $100 to $50,000 or more, per violation, with a calendar year cap of $1,500,000. A covered entity will not receive a penalty if the failure to comply was not due to willful neglect and was corrected within 30 days of identification that the error occurred; or, if the Department of Justice imposed a criminal penalty. Penalties can be reduced at the discretion of OCR if the failure to comply was due to reasonable cause, and the penalty would be excessive based on the nature and extent of the noncompliance.

The Department of Justice is responsible for criminal prosecutions under the Privacy Rule. Criminal penalties are imposed when a person knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in a way that violates the Privacy Rule. The penalties begin at $50,000 and up to one-year imprisonment and increase to $100,000 and up to five-years imprisonment if the conduct involved false pretenses; or, as much as $250,000 and up to 10-years imprisonment if the conduct involves the intent to sell, transfer, or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm.

### Security Rule
HIPAA security regulations adopted administrative, technical, and physical safeguards necessary to prevent unauthorized access to PHI. The standards, in effect for all covered entities since April 20, 2006, are designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI a covered entity creates, receives, maintains, or transmits. The intent is to identify and protect against reasonably anticipated threats to the security or integrity of the information and protect against reasonably anticipated impermissible uses and disclosures.

The Security Rule defines “confidentiality” to mean ePHI is not available or disclosed to unauthorized persons. The Security Rule’s confidentiality requirements support the Privacy Rule’s prohibitions against improper uses and disclosures of PHI. The Security Rule also promotes the integrity and availability of ePHI. Under the Security Rule, “integrity” means ePHI is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner. “Availability” means ePHI is accessible and usable on demand by an authorized person.

The Security Rule is flexible and scalable to allow covered entities to analyze their own needs and implement solutions appropriate for their specific environments. What is appropriate for a covered entity will depend on the nature of the covered entity’s business, as well as the covered entity’s size and resources.

> ### The [[HIPAA]] Security Rule is comprised of three levels of safeguards:
1. **Administrative safeguards**: These safeguards address your operations. They include assigning responsibility to someone for security and having policies and procedures in place to direct your security efforts.
	>
2. **Physical safeguards**: These safeguards include locks and keys, where computers are located, how electronic media are disposed of, and generally how to make the environment safe.
	>
3. **Technical safeguards**: These safeguards are controls directly applied to information systems. They identify who may have access to information systems, provide access to sets of data and specific functions in systems, [[audit]] persons who have used the systems, and protect the systems from malicious software.

HHS provides the following summary detail for each of these three safeguards:

#### Administrative Safeguards
Risk analysis should be an ongoing process in which a covered entity regularly reviews records to track access to ePHI and detect security incidents, periodically evaluates the effectiveness of security measures put in place, and regularly re-evaluates potential risks to ePHI. Processes include:

>** Security Management:** A covered entity must analyze potential risks to ePHI and implement security measures that reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level.

>** Security Personnel:** A covered entity must designate a security official who is responsible for developing and implementing security policies and procedures.

> **Information Access Management:** Consistent with the Privacy Rule standard limiting uses and disclosures of PHI to the “minimum necessary,” the Security Rule requires a covered entity to implement policies and procedures for authorizing access to ePHI only when such access is appropriate based on the user or recipient’s role (role-based access).

> **Workforce Training and Management:** A covered entity must provide appropriate authorization and supervision of workforce members who work with ePHI. A covered entity must train all workforce members regarding its security policies and procedures and adopt and apply appropriate sanctions against workforce members who violate its policies and procedures.
> **Evaluation**: A covered entity must perform a periodic assessment of how well security policies and procedures meet the requirements of the Security Rule.
			
#### Physical Safeguards
>**Facility Access and Control:** A covered entity must limit physical access to its facilities while ensuring authorized access is allowed.

>**Workstation and Device Security:** A covered entity must implement policies and procedures to specify proper use of and access to workstations and electronic media. A covered entity also must have in place policies and procedures regarding the transfer, removal, disposal, and re-use of electronic media, to ensure appropriate protection of ePHI.
			
#### Technical Safeguards
>**Access Control:** A covered entity must implement technical policies and procedures that allow only authorized persons to access ePHI.

>**Audit Controls:** A covered entity must implement hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms to record and examine access and other activity in information systems that contain or use ePHI.

>**Integrity Controls:** A covered entity must implement policies and procedures to ensure ePHI is not improperly altered or destroyed. Electronic measures must be put in place to confirm ePHI has not been improperly altered or destroyed.

>**Transmission Security:** A covered entity must implement technical security measures that guard against unauthorized access to ePHI being transmitted over an electronic network.
