# Purpose of Clinical Documentation Improvement
Clinical documentation improvement is a prevailing topic in the healthcare industry. Clinical documentation is the catalyst for [[coding]], billing, and [[Audit|auditing]] and is the conduit for and provides evidence of the quality and continuity of patient care. This course was created to prepare experienced coders, auditors, and clinical professionals for the [[Certified Documentation Expert Inpatient (CDEI)]] certification exam. Individuals who hold a CDEI credential are clinical documentation improvement (CDI) experts for inpatient services performed in the hospital setting. The competencies tested on the CDEI exam covered in this training include benefits of CDI programs, documentation requirements, quality measures, payment methodologies, and clinical conditions including common signs and symptoms, typical treatment, documentation tips and [[coding]] concepts.

[[Coding]] and reimbursement professionals are at the center of clinical documentation improvement. This aspect of healthcare services not only includes [[coding]] and billing, but also reaches beyond to include the documentation of quality and improvement of care.

Clinical documentation improvement is a proactive measure. There must be consistency and attention to detail to improve clinical documentation. The focus of documentation improvement should not be solely directed on reimbursement. Though reimbursement for inpatient care is directly correlated to a hospitals case mix index (CMI), programs set up with the purpose to maximize revenue may cause compliance risks. Especially if it is determined the program is designed to lead the provider and the facility to upcoding for greater reimbursement. Because a hospitals CMI reflects the severity level of procedures and care required to treat patients at their facility, [[CMS]] uses this measure to determine reimbursement. The more severe the condition and costly the care provided the greater reimbursement will be. Because of compliance issues, successful CDI programs focus on supporting the documented clinical conditions, treatment and management of provided conditions, and outcomes of treatment. This results in an accurate CMI amongst other positive effects.

Every facility should have a designated clinical documentation expert; sometimes called a clinical documentation specialist (CDS). Job titles may vary for this position, others include quality assurance auditors, DRG validation auditor, quality improvement auditors, and clinical record auditors. Throughout this training, CDEI will be used to refer to clinical documentation specialist in the inpatient setting.

If the facility is relatively large, a team of individuals working together for clinical documentation improvement can manage compliance. The CDEI must be knowledgeable in the hospital setting in which they are working, and able to understand the requirements for [[coding]] and reporting, including following the proper inpatient [[coding]] guidelines. The CDEI must also be proficient in the areas of terminology, anatomy, and pathophysiology, to better understand the clinical component of conditions and treatments. This will help to accurately report procedures as well as comorbidities.

The CDEI will develop and monitor policies and procedures affecting the documentation process. Facilities may have different needs based on the type of hospital and the services provided. CDI should begin at the front end of all services and care, therefore Prevention of documentation deficiencies is the key. CDEIs will work with all individuals within the facility who play a role in the documentation process.

# The Professional Side of Clinical Documentation
The need for analyzing clinical documentation beyond coding and reimbursement becomes more evident every day. There is a heightened awareness and demand for clinical documentation improvement. The reasons include:
			
- Patient involvement — more patients are requesting their medical records. A copy of the legal record must contain all necessary information that represents the care provided to the patient for continuity of care.
- Increasing regulatory demands for evidence-based patient care.
- Increasing use of the [[electronic medical record]] ([[Electronic Medical Record|EMR]]), including issues involved with implementing the [[Electronic Medical Record|EMR]] and the need for continuous accuracy and compliance.
- More frequent audits performed with the intent to recover payments.
- The healthcare industry, with the use of the electronic resources, can now afford to aggressively investigate and enforce compliance through audits, [[Overpayment and Recoupment|recoupment]], and [[denial]] of payments.
			
These and other demands are creating a tremendous compliance burden for all healthcare providers, while broadening the scope and responsibilities of [[coding]] and [[Audit|auditing]] professionals.

[[Coding]] professionals and auditors already perform many aspects of clinical documentation improvement and will continue to do so; therefore coders and auditors will be required to become more proficient within the inpatient setting to facilitate the quality of information documented for each hospital stay.

As coders and auditors, we look at documentation to determine the services that should be billed. CDEIs look at the documentation to determine how to improve documentation to accurately communicate the patient care, adhere to regulatory requirements (e.g., consent forms for treatment are signed), as well as what should be documented to support services.

In large facilities, the responsibility of documentation improvement for patient care and quality assurance is carved out of the coding, compliance, and quality departments. The increasing volume of work in these areas is reshaping the workflow, as well. The changes in healthcare and technology are requiring a central focus on CDI and working documentation reviews concurrently.

Clinical documentation will always be an inherent part of coding and [[Audit|auditing]]; however, industry changes require additional objectives for the review of the medical record. The demand for coders, auditors, and CDEIs is the result of these industry changes. Healthcare and the responsibilities of the professionals working within the business side of medicine continuously evolve, requiring the skilled auditor, coding professional, and CDEI to work as a team to facilitate effective change where needed and to identify and manage all issues concerning clinical documentation.

# The Role of the Clinical Documentation Expert Inpatient
Many facilities will employ a CDEI to work in tandem with auditors and coding professionals. The responsibilities of the CDEI, the auditor, and even the HIM coder may overlap; however, there are fundamental differences in the responsibilities for each position.

>## **A coding professional's responsibilities include:**
>
- Review of the medical record to assign ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS codes supported by the documentation. 
- Assign the appropriate principal diagnosis codes, MS-DRGs, POA indicators, and discharge status codes. 
- Provide education to coding staff or providers.
- Assign deficiencies in the form of queries to improve documentation to support accuracy and specificity of coding. 
			
> ## **An auditor’s responsibilities include:**
>
- Review of the record for documentation to support the ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS codes selected, and the coding and billing processes, after the [[Claim Form|claims]] have been submitted. 
- Develop reports related to the [[audit]] findings.
- Identify coding and documentation deficiencies that cause financial impact (overcoding or undercoding).
- Analyze [[data]] for missed charges.
- Provide education based on [[audit]] findings to the staff and providers.
			
The CDEI looks at the record [[with]] a different objective. 

>## **The CDEI’s responsibilities are more proactive and include:**
>		
- Develop and monitor internal protocols for the staff responsible for entering patient and insurance [[data]].
- Perform ongoing reviews for accurate [[data]].
- Establish, maintain, and monitor policies and procedures to reduce risk. For example: patient instructions, and documentation that the patient understands the instructions for the forms that are completed:
	- Informed consents
	- Assignment of benefits
	- Hospital Issued Notice of Non-coverage (HINN)
	- [[HIPAA]] consent
	- Patient intake forms and updates
	- Patient signatures and completion of forms
- Review the medication lists and make sure the lists are updated (for example, if a patient reports that they stopped taking a medication, but this is not updated in the medical [[record]], it may result in a negative patient outcome).
- Review the assessment and plan and make sure the lists are updated when significant changes occur.
- Monitor allergies are updated in the medical record.
- Verify documentation supports quality care.
- Proper use of acronyms.
- Correcting a deficient record.
- Prevent note cloning.

These lists are not all inclusive. Depending on the CDI program, additional responsibilities may be required.
			
# Benefits of an Effective CDI Program
Implementing a CDI program in your facility will impact different areas of the organization. Hospitals with an effective CDI program can see a reduction of [[Denial|denials]], improvement of reimbursement based on proper code selection, and quality measurement compliance. CDI programs have been growing for the past several years and they have become accepted in different hospitals throughout the United States.

> ## **The benefits of a CDI program include:**
			
- Correct ICD-10-CM code selection 
- Correct ICD-10-PCS code selection
- Proper MS-DRG reimbursement
- Improvement in quality measures
- Avoidance of [[Denial|denials]]
- Superior physician communication 
- Decrease in physician queries
- Opportunity for internal growth
			
The CDEI must be able to aim for the goals listed above for an effective CDI program. As mentioned previously, one of the overall objectives is to improve documentation for patient care. To be able to have a unique and successful health experience for the patients, the clinical documentation must be proper and paint the picture of the patient’s status and outcome of the treatment. Missing, conflicting, or incomplete documentation will only lead to negative outcomes in various aspects that will affect the facility.
			
# Best Practices 
The CDEI must monitor the timeliness of the documentation. Providers who are habitually late with documentation may leave out the details needed for patient-centered documentation. It is recommended that the provider document within 24 hours of care being provided, including after the patient is discharged. Most facilities will have a policy that sets a time limit for record completion. Hospitals will also have a policy for the time limit for authentication of an electronic health record, which typically ranges from 24 hours to a few days.

The CDEI reviews the findings from auditors to determine what should be done to remedy the documentation deficiencies. Action plans are created to focus on the deficiencies identified. The action plans will vary by specialty, provider, and type of deficiency. To be effective, the CDI plan must be flexible to meet the needs of the hospital.
			
The CDEI may have the responsibility of educating the providers on [[medical necessity]] requirements and documentation requirements of procedures and services the provider performs. The CDEI will review the records for quality of content, structure, and technical issues within the record.

> ### **The CDEI will review the record for comprehensiveness, answering questions such as:**
			
- Can the complete medical record stand alone?
- Does the information in the record show evidence of the nature and severity of the problem?
- Are all conditions, findings, and treatment documented adequately in the medical record?
- Is there evidence of the services rendered and charges reported?
- Is the provider’s assessment and plan complete enough for another clinician to take over the case?
- If the record were evidence in court, would it be comprehensive enough to support and protect the provider and/or facility?
			
The CDEI must also be able to train providers on the importance of detailed and quality documentation. Most providers have an inherent knowledge of what should be documented for clinical standards; however, there is a gap between clinical standards and the coding systems and published [[medical necessity]] requirements. Most providers document reasonably well for medical care but are unaware of the details needed for accurate code selection and quality measures purposes.

The medical record serves a multitude of purposes. The CDEI plays a vital role in ensuring providers are documenting appropriately for ALL aspects of the healthcare industry.

Many in the industry have heard, “if it isn’t documented, it’ didn’t happen.” If the documentation does not include all the information from each date of service, the facility’s reimbursement will be impacted. There are many instances where the provider will use clinical knowledge to arrive at a decision but if it is not included in the documentation another provider using that documentation to continue treatment is missing valuable information that could assist in the patient’s care. For the coding professional this can cause confusion and affect code selection when clinical indicators, signs and symptoms, or other findings are not clarified by the provider.

There are many official resources that mention the importance of documentation and the requirements for it to be considered complete. “The failure of hospital staff to: (i) document items and services rendered; and (ii) properly submit them for reimbursement is a [[Major Surgery|major]] area of potential [[fraud]] and [[abuse]] in Federal health care programs. The OIG has undertaken numerous audits, investigations, inspections and national enforcement initiatives aimed at reducing potential and actual [[fraud]], [[abuse]] and waste.” Federal Register/Vol. 63, No. 35/Monday, February 23,1998/Notices Page 8987

For many different reasons, failure to accurately document is a daily occurrence, another reason for the heightened emphasis on clinical documentation improvement. If providers were documenting appropriately for the services rendered and billed, there would be no need for the emphasis on education, nor would payers employ entire departments whose only task is to [[audit]] the documentation associated with [[Claim Form|claims]] and services rendered. Coding and reporting must be accurate to have the claim paid correctly.

If [[medical necessity]] requirements and documentation requirements are not met, the payer may ask for a [[Overpayment and Recoupment|recoupment]] of [[Overpayment and Recoupment|overpayment]]. [[Claim Form|Claims]] may meet the technical coding requirements; however, the documentation fails to meet the [[medical necessity]] for the services rendered or ordered.

# Documentation Quality
Quality assurance in patient care is only evident if it is documented in the medical record. Quality services may have been provided; however, if this is not evident within the medical record, problems may arise.

For example, another provider (or the same provider several weeks later) will not necessarily know the details of the previous encounter or hospital admission. In the inpatient setting, you will have patients that will not come back for months or even years later, depending on the circumstances. During prolonged admissions patients may also see several different providers on rotation. Providers can’t always rely on the patient to inform them of their history during the stay. For example, the provider may ask the patient what medications they are taking, and the patient responds, “I take the purple one in the morning.” If the provider has not documented the type of medication and proper dose in the patient’s record, they will have no idea what the patient is taking and whether they are taking it correctly. This can create a risk for patient care and doesn’t accurately reflect the patient’s condition

If the provider instructs the patient on the risks and benefits of a procedure and how to properly take medication but fails to document the instructions given and that the patient understood all the instructions, the provider has made themself and the hospital vulnerable if the patient has any type of misadventure.

Records are scrutinized by multiple entities. Providers and facilities are being challenged to put their best foot forward in many ways. The only evidence the providers have of their veracity and the quality of care provided is the medical record.

When it comes to understanding the reimbursement methodology for inpatient services, it all comes down to applying the select [[Medicare]] Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG). The MS-DRG is based on the selection of the principal diagnosis, the conditions being treated throughout the stay which can be classified as complications or comorbidities (CC) or major complications or comorbidities (MCC). The disposition status and type of surgical procedures patients undergo can also impact the selection of the MS-DRG and therefore the reimbursement to the hospital. For example, if a patient comes to the hospital with a decubitus pressure ulcer, but the provider fails to document or address this condition, the coder might not pick up the diagnosis for the pressure ulcer, which could result in a lower MS-DRG, meaning a lower reimbursement for the hospital. We will discuss MS-DRGs in greater detail in a later chapter.

As mentioned previously, the purpose of CDI is not only for accurate reimbursement, but primarily documentation improvement and integrity; which supports better patient care. Because the medical record is a legal document and used for more than tracking a patient care during admission, there are additional reasons to maintain the quality of it.

>**Requests for medical records come from many sources, for different reasons other than reimbursement. For example:**
>			
- [[CMS]] Contractors
- Patients
- Attorneys
- Other providers
- Workers’ compensation
- Payers for pre-certification
- Pre-employment applications
- Military application
- SSI applications
			
Incomplete, cloned, or deficient records, regardless of the type of deficiency or errors providing evidence of non-compliance, are a very poor representation of the clinician or the facility. The goal for the CDEI is to work with the facilities, clinicians, and staff in the entire documentation process to facilitate excellence and compliance in the documentation of all medical records entries.

In addition to facilitating high quality patient care, a properly documented medical record verifies and documents the services that are provided. 

>**The medical record may be used to validate:**
>
- Place of service
- [[Medical necessity]] for the services provided
- Coding accuracy
- Identity of the provider
			
>**Examples of internal documentation guidelines a facility might use to ensure accurate medical record documentation include the following:**
>
- The medical record is complete and legible;
- The documentation of each patient encounter includes the reason for the encounter; any relevant history; physical examination findings; prior diagnostic test results; assessment, clinical impression, or diagnosis; plan of care; and date and legible identity of the observer;
- If not documented, the rationale for ordering diagnostic and other ancillary services can be easily inferred by an independent reviewer or third party who may not have medical training;
- ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS codes used for claims submission are supported by documentation and the medical record; and
- Appropriate health risk factors are identified. The patient’s progress, their response to, and any changes in, treatment, and any revision in diagnosis are documented.
			
The ICD–10–CM and ICD-10-PCS codes reported on the health insurance [[Claim Form|claims form]] should be supported by documentation in the medical record and the medical chart should contain all necessary information. Additionally, [[CMS]] and the local carriers should be able to determine the person who provided the services. These issues can be the root cause of investigations for inappropriate or erroneous conduct and have been identified by [[CMS]] and the OIG as a leading cause of improper payments.

The goal for CDEI is the same for all facilities; the challenges may vary based on the facility type.

**Inpatient hospital:** An example of a challenge in the inpatient hospital setting is monitoring documentation for multiple providers involved in patient care. Maintaining consistent and quality documentation can be difficult because deficiencies may not be identified until after the provider has left the facility.
			
**Nursing home facilities:** An example of a challenge in this type of facility is the proper reimbursement for services performed by other providers when the patient is in a nursing home. The nursing home is responsible for coordinating care for patients admitted to their care.

**Home healthcare entities:** An example of a challenge for home health agencies is obtaining a compliant plan of care from the [[ordering provider]]. Without it, services are not justified.

Medical record documentation should be ==patient centered.== The basic premise of medical record documentation is to promote the highest standard of continuity of care.

We must:
			
- Improve the communication and the dissemination of information between and across all providers of services
- Provide the appropriate treatment, intervention, and plan of care
- Improve goal setting and evaluation of care outcomes
- Improve early detection of problems and changes in health status
- Provide “EVIDENCE” of excellent patient care
			
## Financial Impact
A significant effect of incomplete documentation in a patient’s medical record is loss in revenue. The inaccuracy of medical documentation is a clear indicator to the CDEI that payments may be inaccurate.

Incomplete documentation can lead to undercoding or overcoding a service. For example, the patient presents for admission to the hospital for congestive heart failure exacerbation. It was documented the patient has a past medical history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease. There was no documentation of the stage of the patient’s kidney disease. After the coder reviews the documentation, the codes will reflect I13.0 for hypertension, I50.9 for congestive heart failure unspecified, and N18.9 for chronic kidney disease, unspecified stage. Not having documentation for the type of heart failure (diastolic, systolic, both) and the chronicity (acute or chronic) will cause the MS-DRG selection to be “without CC/MCC.” Not having the stage of the chronic kidney disease affects the MS-DRG selection in the same way. This will result in a decrease in reimbursement as the MS-DRG will consider the patient's condition as less severe.

## Legal Protection
The details in a well-documented note are a provider’s best defense in any legal situation. If the record is deficient in details, there is no “evidence” to support a provider’s testimony. Evidence of procedures and care provided — or not provided or documented — is just as important in the legal aspect as it is in the billing and patient care.

# Mastering the Documentation Process
1. Know the required documentation for the service rendered.
2. Educate providers to complete the documentation as soon as possible after the service.
3. Develop tools to assist with consistency.
4. Follow up with [[Audit|auditing]].
5. Educate providers and staff.

The accuracy of the documentation in the medical record is equally as important as its completeness. Accuracy assists in providing patients with optimal medical care based on details provided in their medical records.

Another reason for ensuring accuracy in the medical record is to provide governmental agencies and any other entity accessing the patient’s medical record with accurate and complete information. One way to ensure an [[audit]] is to send a record that demonstrates a trend of inaccuracies when the record is requested for review. 

>**Examples of common deficiencies that are simple to prevent include:**
>		
- Sloppy text
- Misspelled words
- Phrases that do not make sense
- Dictation that is not complete
- Skips in the text that indicate the words were not understood
- Incomplete sentences
- Evidence of cloning or copying data from previous dates of service that is not relevant to the current service
- Incorrect dates of service
- Missing dates of service
- Missing dosage and strength of medication ordered
- Missing orders for diagnostic tests
	
These are only a few examples that are common errors in documentation. It should be assumed that all clinical documentation will be scrutinized at some point.

With improved documentation, collections improve. If diagnoses are reported in the medical record and are not reported on the claim form, this can result in [[Denial|denied]] claims. Accuracy of documentation ensures the claims go out correctly the first time, and the need to re-bill corrected claims or appeal claims held for additional information is minimized.

The documentation justifies the reason for the medical care provided. The [[medical necessity]] must be clearly indicated for all services rendered and for diagnostic or other ancillary services ordered. Improved documentation (for example, which medications are prescribed, and which diagnostic tests have been ordered) assists the staff and other providers with the information they need to perform their duties, regardless of their department or area of care.

The OIG states an ongoing chart evaluation process is critical to a successful compliance program. This is one of the many reasons for clinical documentation improvement.

The only way to know if the documentation is deficient is to have internal policies to monitor the documentation. Developing a systematic process of review, identification, correction, and provider education is required to maintain consistent quality documentation. A formal review with a report of findings has a greater impact than communication to the provider on a case-by-case basis. The objective is to identify and remedy the deficiencies, eliminating the number of case-by-case queries.

The extent and frequency of chart audits will vary based on the size of the facility. Every facility should have a mechanism in place for routine periodic chart review. The more reviews performed over time, the less likely major problems will present. Documentation improvement is an ongoing process and becomes more manageable with each step.

Other policies and procedures may be appropriate for the overall compliance process. By ensuring ethical business practices through compliance programs, facilities reduce their risk of criminal and civil litigation.

Internal protocols and policies should cover topics such as provider queries. The queries can be tracked by provider to demonstrate the documentation areas each provider needs assistance with. Many EMRs have the functionality to allow for the creation of documents within the program that can be emailed to, or put in a task file for, a provider. This form can be dated, timed, and tracked by the system. The EMR can be updated to make the documentation more concise based on the frequency and subject of the queries. The process should be tracked to identify the timeliness of the provider’s response.

Policies should be put in place as to how many queries a provider is allowed before they receive education. There needs to be a protocol as to how and where the queries will be stored. The response from a provider concerning medical care, diagnoses, and/or procedures performed should be kept for evidence of care. The record may need an addendum.

Another protocol to establish is when to release charges, or how long to hold or suspend a claim because of errors or incomplete information. Coders should have specific direction as to how long to hold a claim. If the claim is being held for feedback from the provider because of deficient documentation or questions concerning the claim, there should be policies to accommodate this process. Another effective policy is to determine who will initiate queries and who will follow up to make sure the claim is not lost in the shuffle. These concerns must be tailored to each facility based on size and need.

Policies should be developed concerning typographical errors in transcription and the overutilization of [[Electronic Medical Record|EMR]] templates and pre-populated data. This task should be assigned to an individual who will monitor such use. A timeframe should be established for making corrections.

Policies for corrections of handwritten notes and policies concerning addendums must be systematically in place to facilitate the process of documentation improvement, producing clarity and accuracy.

Protocols for documentation are needed to establish policies for the facility’s use of abbreviations. Abbreviations and symbols can be an effective and efficient form of documentation if their meaning is well understood by the health provider who is using and/or reading them. Abbreviations should have clear definitions and be used facility wide for consistency in documenting and abstracting.

# Implementation of a CDI Program
Professionals who assist in ensuring the quality, accuracy, and integrity of the medical record are in great demand. Documentation improvement is far reaching and may involve several people or several departments within your organization to be a comprehensive, effective program. Designate an individual to oversee the documentation improvement process.

Assign a physician advocate and the compliance officer to assist with the management and enforcement of the policies. Including a physician advocate will help encourage the other providers to participate, assist with provider education, and build a stronger program with physician engagement and investment in the program.

Employ a coder or auditor to manage aspects of the documentation improvement process associated with coding, billing, and reimbursement. (This teamwork uses the skills and expertise of the coding and [[Audit|auditing]] professionals when the CDI process overlaps.) Involve all departments that play a role in the documentation process (nurses, data entry staff, etc.).

- Assign one individual in each department the responsibility of working with the CDEI to assist in resolving documentation issues for that department.
- Identify the facility needs within each department.
- Work with the highest risk area first, utilizing authoritative guidelines and instructions.
- Develop policies and protocols that meet the needs of your facility that are effective but not overwhelming. For example, policies for:
	- Adding late entries
	- Corrections to medical records
	- Timeliness of documentation
	- Who has the permission to input data in the [[Electronic Medical Record|EMR]]
	- Policies concerning the use of acronyms
	- Policies for risk prevention
- Create templates that will assist with better detail and compliance with specialty-specific documentation mandates.
- Review provider reports based on the quality and accuracy of information.
- Schedule regular educational meetings for CDI team, providers, and staff.
- Perform regular audits for monitoring.
- Monitor the policies and procedures for effectiveness and change when needed.
- Conduct appropriate training and education.

The CDEI must train providers on the importance of detailed and quality documentation. Most providers have an inherent knowledge of what should be documented for clinical standards; however, there is a gap between clinical standards and the coding systems.

To effectively educate the provider, we must first understand the level of respect that is required. The CDEI must demonstrate respect for the providers and their situations. They must establish integrity and accountability.

Coding professionals, auditors, and CDEIs must earn credibility with those being trained. All professionals responsible for educating providers must do so with current, accurate, and authoritative information. Trainers should never be aggressive, demanding, or insulting. It is important that the provider or administrator set the stage and conditions for training whenever possible.

There are times that individuals are required to undergo training as part of compliance measures for a facility. It is important to understand that providers and staff members may be frustrated and perceive the training as a waste of their time. At times, they may be difficult to work with. Never take unpleasant responses and inappropriate comments personally. As a trainer, it is your responsibility to communicate the information in the most professional manner, to create the most positive and effective results.

Additionally, when educating physicians, it is best practice to always refer to all necessary coding and documentation guidelines, if applicable. Some of these resources include ICD-10-CM guidelines, ICD-10-PCS guidelines, and the AHA Coding Clinics. When communicating with a provider, it’s helpful to provide references that are required by [[CMS]], as this will not only provide credibility, but will also increase the level of knowledge you are providing to the providers.

You must understand what the provider responds to best. Some providers simply want to be told what to do. Others want to read every document you can provide to support the instruction and guidance. When providing feedback to a provider regarding documentation deficiencies, the most effective action is to provide examples of their own documentation with feedback for improvement because it allows them to understand the deficiency and how to improve.

When training providers, it is best not to use abstracts. Use data that is meaningful and information pertinent to the deficiency. The CDEI must focus on data that needs attention and correction. This may involve the process of demonstrating a loss in reimbursement. Demonstrating the risk factors in terms of payment [[Overpayment and Recoupment|recoupment]], prepayment audits, and potential fines and consequences as the result of being non-compliant is also effective. Normally, providers will respond to at least one of these demonstrations.

Education is an important part of any compliance program and is the logical next step after problems have been identified and the facility has designated a person to oversee educational training.

Ideally, education programs will be tailored to the facility’s needs, specialty, and size, and will include both compliance and specific training.

>**There are three basic steps for setting up educational objectives:**
>
1. Determine who needs training (both in coding and billing and in compliance);
2. Determine the type of training that best suits the facility’s needs (e.g., seminars, in-service training, self-study, or other programs); and
3. Determine when and how often education is needed, and how much each person should receive.

Training may be accomplished through a variety of means, including in-person training sessions (i.e., either onsite or at outside seminars), distribution of newsletters, or even a readily accessible office bulletin board. Regardless of the training modality used, a facility should ensure that the necessary education is communicated effectively and that the facility’s employees come away from the training with a better understanding of the issues covered.

# Type of Chart Reviews
As previously mentioned, a complete and accurate medical record benefits not only the clinician and the hospital, but also the patient. Medical records are used for a variety of purposes like facilitating continued care, creating preventative treatment plans, litigating, and more. The use of medical records is so versatile and consequential that every CDEI must become familiar with a variety of approaches for reviewing them.

Chart reviews can be performed for [[medical necessity]] determinations, legal justification, workers’ compensation and disability claims, clinical documentation improvement, coding accuracy, insurance coverage determination, research of diseases and progression, and quality improvement. Every review is based on objectives to prevent future errors or improve medical documentation for quality of care and treatment. Along with these objective specific types of a reviews the job function of a CDEI involves the practice of two other main types of review, concurrent review and retrospective review. Rarely in the inpatient setting are prospective reviews performed, as inpatients generally are not planned and are acute or emergent in nature. We will discuss reviews for [[medical necessity]], concurrent reviews, and retrospective reviews in greater detail.

## Medical Necessity Reviews
The [[Medicare]] glossary defines medical necessities as “health care services or supplies needed to diagnose or treat an illness, injury, condition, disease, or its symptoms and that meet accepted standards of medicine.” In other words, any medical service that meets accepted standards of clinical practice and is also considered necessary to diagnose or treat an illness, injury, condition, disease, or symptom could be considered “medically necessary.”

CDEI specialists can often be overheard asking one another if a particular treatment was medically required to address a particular patient’s ailment. That’s because every CDEI specialist recognizes the importance of maintaining an informed understanding of the relationships between treatment options and specific ailments. This type of specialized knowledge is especially valuable when working in a hospital setting where any service found unjustifiable risks the possibility of insurance [[Denial|denials]] as well as other consequences. A service can be found unjustifiable for a variety of reasons, even an accidental omission of patient information during the documentation process can cause a service to be deemed unjustified.

When reviewing medical documentation, question if the services provided to a patient were valid based on the patient’s signs and symptoms or illness. Only the documentation that is found in the medical record can lead the coders and CDEI specialists to code for relevant conditions treated throughout the stay of the patient. If new conditions are introduced that the provider didn’t address, then it will be the responsibility of the CDEI to query the provider based on supporting clinical indicators. The documentation must speak for itself without inconsistency or conflicting outcomes.

## Concurrent and Retrospective Reviews
CDEI job responsibilities can vary depending on the facility you were hired by or the role in which you work. You may have a greater focus on audits or only perform retrospective reviews. In other facilities CDEI work closely with coders to select the Principal diagnosis and working MS-DRG. Either way, it’s important to understand the different types of reviews and how they are utilized to improve compliance, documentation, and reimbursement.

During a concurrent review a patient’s record is reviewed while they are actively admitted. Depending on the facility concurrent reviews can take place for each patient each day of care. Or the facility may have a policy that coders review records daily and every few days the patients record is reviewed by CDI. 

>**Either way a concurrent review includes reviewing the documentation for [[medical necessity]] along with the following:**
>
- Orders for diagnostic or ancillary services should include a rationale which can be easily inferred if it is not specifically documented.
- Past and present conditions that are related or clinically significant conditions should be documented. 
- Health risk factors should be identified.
- Patients progress and response to treatment should be clear and support charges.
- Accuracy, acuity, and specify of ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS codes
- Identification of hospital acquired conditions (HAC)
- Accuracy of working MS-DRG
- Review of other deficiencies related to quality documentation and assign queries
			
This list is not all inclusive and depending on the facility a coder may be responsible for some of these aspects of a concurrent review rather than the CDEI. Time is of the essence during a concurrent review. The quicker a provider can be queried, or other deficiencies can be assigned and resolved, the faster the concurrent coding and working MS-DRG can be updated to reflect the patient’s condition. Concurrent reviews can be considered preventative as they help to improve coding [[Prior authorization|prior]] to claims [[denial]] or other billing related issues. They also actively improve the portrayal of care provided and the patients condition during the stay which can have a direct effect on patient care.

A retrospective review is done after the patient is discharged and the claim is processed. Retrospective reviews can be part of an [[audit]] function performed by CDEI by some facilities. Audits can include all claims or focus on specific MS-DRGs, diagnoses, or procedures. Findings by the reviews can be used for hospital statistics or to identify education opportunities. Education can be coder or provider specific, or both. A retrospective review generally includes reviewing the documentation for deficiencies in a similar manner as a concurrent review. But may also include review of present on admission indicators (POA), discharge status codes, query response at time of billing, medication reconciliation, patient education on discharge, SOI/ROM capture, CC/MCC capture, and other patient safety indicators.

## Healthcare Data Analytics
Healthcare data analytics play a major role when it comes to analyzing clinical information. This process allows the review of historical medical data to predict trends, improve plans of care, and manage the spread of diseases. The information used in healthcare data analytics can provide financial and administrative data that could be used in better efforts for patient care and improve the outcome of the procedures.

As a CDEI specialist, deploying a plan with healthcare data can help optimize and improve several areas of operations within the hospital facility. Understanding data analytics can assist with various sections to improve the hospital’s needs. Think about the medical staff that needs to work at a hospital. How many general surgeons are needed? Is there a need to bring a cardiothoracic surgeon based on the population’s diseases? Are there enough ancillary staff to better assist physicians and provide the best care for patients? These are some questions that can be answered with the assistance of data analytics.

With the assistance of CDI specialists, it’s best to establish internal processes for how the healthcare data will be procured directed, saved, interchanged, and analyzed in a way that the organization can benefit. In doing so the data will become a positive asset to the organization.

## Using Appeals to Identify Provider Education
As a CDEI specialist, it becomes exceedingly important what methods and resources to use for provider education. It is always suggested to use provider notes that need to be amended or corrected in some way, to be able to show the physicians the discrepancies that are found. A CDEI will not work with insurances to bill claims and appeal them, but will work closely with the coders, billers, and auditors to review and determine if a [[denial]] could’ve been prevented based on clinical documentation.

This course will assist you in identifying appeals that would be applicable to physician education based on clinical indicators, [[medical necessity]], and conflicting documentation. There are cases in which the providers can give a specific diagnosis that is age-based that could cause a [[denial]]. For example, code N60.11 Diffuse cystic mastopathy of right breast, is a code only applicable to patients who are age 15 and older based on ICD-10-CM instructions. If a provider gives a diagnosis of fibrocystic breast changes to a 12-year-old patient, and the software does not detect this discrepancy, the claim will be billed and a [[denial]] will be received. This information can be used to educate physicians to prevent any future [[Denial|denials]]. Not only that, but this will also assist with proper code selection for patient care that will not create conflict with physician documentation.

There can be situations in which a claim may be [[Denial|denied]] or part of the reimbursement could be recouped based on the conditions reported for the MS-DRG selection. Note cloning is a helpful method for providers to document without spending much time, but if not used appropriately, it could cause a new problem to the facility. If a physician is copying and pasting without accurately reflecting the diagnoses treated during the hospital stay, a condition that is considered a CC or MCC could be coded without really being there at the time of the hospital admission. This could lead to higher reimbursement and later become a [[Overpayment and Recoupment|recoupment]] for not supporting the condition clinically.

There will be different circumstances in which claims can be [[Denial|denied]] for data entry errors, ineligibility, or non-covered services. [[Medical necessity]] is also a major contributor, in which physician education is required if the providers are not clearly stating the justification for a service a patient requires.

## CDI Software
Every hospital will conduct CDI plans with different approaches that will fit the hospital standards. There are electronic systems that can facilitate the use of CDI with specific tools that will be integral on a successful CDI implementation. There are various systems with the ability to detect keywords and automatically enhance improvement in clinical documentation as well as to detect query opportunities.

As a CDEI specialist, you will be required to become familiar with hospital policies and system requirements to be able to use these tools to implement a compliant process that will allow for better accuracy and overall patient care documentation.

The use of natural language processing (NLP) and computer-assisted coding (CAC) are components that tend to be applied in most CDI programs. The NLP is a tool that consists of artificial intelligence to find key information from unstructured written or spoken processes. Use of CAC is commonly seen for accurate code selection, but still requires manual review. With the proper implementation of a CDI software and program, hospitals tend to see improvements in clinical and financial outcomes.

## Enforcement of Protocols
There must be a process to enforce the protocols put in place as preventive measures. This can be part of the CDEI’s responsibility, or the responsibility of the health information management (HIM) director. 

>**Some actions that can be taken to enforce compliance are:**
>	
- Holding the claim for processing until all documentation deficiencies are resolved. The providers as well as other pertinent hospital administration are aware claims will not be processed until the requested information is completed.
- In severe cases of deficient documentation, have a CDEI review all records [[Prior authorization|prior]] to coding and processing of claims.
- Employ scribes to document the services at the time the services are rendered until the provider is amenable to the internal policies and procedures the facility has in place.
			
Quick response and action for all detected deficiencies are required to facilitate an effective protocol. If the policies and procedures developed by the hospital are not adhered to, the entire process will be devalued.

Above are suggestions for practical applications in developing a CDI program. Each plan must be tailored to meet the unique needs of the facility. Adhering to state, federal, and individual payer mandates is paramount; however, patient care is the overarching objective for CDI. CDI is a project that will continuously evolve as changes continue. The need for CDI will never go away — the demand will only increase.
