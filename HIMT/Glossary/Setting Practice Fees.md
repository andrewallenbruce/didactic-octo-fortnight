If you've been reading my newsletter or articles for long, you know that I normally recommend you have one fee schedule set at about 2 to 2.5 times the Medicare allowed amount, although in 49 states—there is no restriction on you having multiple fee schedules. Texas is different. It is the only state that I know of that has mandated—through insurance code—that you charge all insurance plans the same fee. Section 552 of the Texas Insurance code does exclude:

1.  Medicaid or Medicare patient or a patient who is covered by a federal, state, or local government-sponsored indigent health care program.
    
2.  financially or medically indigent person who qualifies for indigent health care services based on:
	1.  a sliding fee scale; or
	2.  a written charity care policy established by a healthcare provider; or
	3.  person who is not covered by a health insurance policy or other health benefit plan
    
The Texas insurance code says a person commits an offense, which is a Class B misdemeanor, if:

1.  the person knowingly or intentionally charges two different prices for providing the same product or service; and
    
2.  the higher price charged is based on the fact that an insurer will pay all or part of the price of the product or service.
    

So—if you are anywhere other than Texas—you can have multiple fee schedules (to the best of my knowledge), but if you’re in Texas, you should charge each of your private insurance plans the same fee.

You can have a charity policy whereby you give a person with no insurance any break you wish to since the section does not apply to patients without insurance.

Many office managers advise their physicians to charge two to three times Medicare’s allowed amounts and that seems to be a pretty safe way to set your fees. Consider the fact that it doesn’t matter what you charge a Medicare patient on an assigned claim, since Medicare’s allowed amount will determine how much you can collect. The fact that most of the private carriers and managed care plans have a set amount they will pay (many are also based on Medicare’s rate) or they may even negotiate with you at a percentage of Medicare also reinforces the thought that it doesn’t matter what you charge – if you’re charging above the amount, they will allow you to collect. The problem arises when I see physicians or managers that set their fees at what they THINK Medicare’s allowed will be or at the amount they THINK the private/managed plan will approve. That is almost always a mistake and the reasoning behind it is (in my opinion) flawed. Some physicians believe that if they charge what Medicare allows, then their adjustments will be less and somehow – that makes the earth spin on its axis better or that it saves them money.

Some managers promote this idea as it makes their collection percentages appear higher. Both reasons are flawed, if you truly realize what collection ratios and adjustments are.
