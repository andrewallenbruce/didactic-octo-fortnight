# Medical Loss Ratio (MLR)
*A basic financial measurement used in the Affordable Care Act to encourage health plans to provide value to enrollees. If an insurer uses 80 cents out of every premium dollar to pay its customers' medical claims and activities that improve the quality of care, the company has a medical loss ratio of 80%. A medical loss ratio of 80% indicates that the insurer is using the remaining 20 cents of each premium dollar to pay overhead expenses, such as marketing, profits, salaries, administrative costs, and agent commissions. The Affordable Care Act sets minimum medical loss ratios for different markets, as do some state laws.*

Medical loss ratio (MLR) is a measure of the percentage of premium dollars that a health plan spends on medical claims and quality improvements, versus administrative costs.

[[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Obamacare]] (the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|ACA]]) requires health insurance carriers to spend the bulk of the premiums they collect on medical expenses for their insureds.  Individual and small-group carriers must spend at least 80 percent of premiums on medical expenses, and for large-group plans, the requirement is 85 percent.

Profits and other administrative expenses can make up no more than 20 percent (15 percent for large groups) of premiums collected.  If administrative expenses exceed those amounts, the insurer must remit rebates to their insureds.

The MLR rules took effect in 2011, with the first rebate checks issued in the fall of 2012. The amount of the rebates is calculated on a three-year rolling average. From 2012 through 2020, insurers had returned nearly $7.8 billion to insureds in the form of rebates for premiums that ultimately ended up being too high (ie, the insurers didn’t spend 80/85 percent of the collected premiums on medical costs and quality improvements). The rebates that were issued in 2020 totaled nearly $2.46 billion, which was by far the highest since the rule went into effect.

The [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|ACA]] also imposes a medical loss ratio requirement of 85 percent on [[Medicare]] Advantage plans, but rebates are sent to the Centers for Medicare and [[Medicaid]] services instead of to consumers.

Many insurance companies spend a substantial portion of consumers’ premium dollars on administrative costs and profits, including executive salaries, overhead, and marketing.

The Affordable Care Act requires health insurance issuers to submit data on the proportion of premium revenues spent on clinical services and quality improvement, also known as the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR). It also requires them to issue rebates to enrollees if this percentage does not meet minimum standards. The Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies to spend at least 80% or 85% of premium dollars on medical care, with the rate review provisions imposing tighter limits on health insurance rate increases. If an issuer fails to meet the applicable MLR standard in any given year, as of 2012, the issuer is required to provide a rebate to its customers.

# Rate Review & the 80/20 Rule
The health care law provides 2 ways to hold insurance companies accountable and help keep your costs down: Rate Review and the 80/20 rule.

## Rate Review

Rate Review helps protect you from unreasonable rate increases. Insurance companies must now publicly explain any rate increase of 15% or more before raising your premium. This does not apply to [grandfathered plans](https://www.healthcare.gov/health-care-law-protections/grandfathered-plans/).

## 80/20 Rule

The 80/20 Rule generally requires insurance companies to spend at least 80% of the money they take in from premiums on health care costs and quality improvement activities. The other 20% can go to administrative, overhead, and marketing costs.

The 80/20 rule is sometimes known as Medical Loss Ratio, or MLR. If an insurance company uses 80 cents out of every premium dollar to pay for your medical claims and activities that improve the quality of care, the company has a Medical Loss Ratio of 80%.

Insurance companies selling to large groups (usually more than 50 employees) must spend at least 85% of premiums on care and quality improvement.

If your insurance company doesn’t meet these requirements, you’ll get a rebate on part of the premium that you paid.

## Will I get a rebate check from my insurance company?

If your insurance company doesn’t meet its 80/20 targets for the year, you’ll get back some of the premium that you paid.

You may see the rebate in a number of ways:

-   A rebate check in the mail
-   A lump-sum deposit into the same account that was used to pay the premium, if you paid by credit card or debit card
-   A direct reduction in your future premium
-   Your employer may also use one of the above rebate methods, or apply the rebate in a way that benefits employees

If you or your employer will get a rebate, your insurance company must notify you by August 1.

If you have an individual insurance policy, you’ll get the rebate directly from your insurance company.

For small group and large group plans, the rebate is usually paid to the employer. It may use one of the above rebate methods, or apply the rebate in a way that benefits employees.

**FYI:** The 80/20 rebate rules don’t apply when an insurance company has fewer than 1000 enrollees in a particular state or market.

## Does this apply to my plan?

It depends.

**For Rate Review:** These requirements don’t apply to [grandfathered plans](https://www.healthcare.gov/health-care-law-protections/grandfathered-plans/). Check your plan’s materials or ask your employer or your benefits administrator to find out if your health plan is grandfathered.

**For the 80/20 Rule:** These rights apply to all individual, small group, and large [[group health plans]], whether your plan is grandfathered or not.
