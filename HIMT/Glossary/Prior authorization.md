# Prior authorization
*A requirement that a physician obtain approval from a health plan to perform a specific service, procedure, or prescribe a specific medication.*

A prior authorization is a requirement imposed by insurance payers to determine the [[medical necessity]] and benefit coverage eligibility before the patient receives a service or undergoes a procedure. When the physician determines the patient needs medical or specialty care, the physician must obtain approval from a health plan to perform a specific service/procedure or
prescribe a specific medication. Without this prior approval, the health plan may not provide coverage, or pay for, the procedure or medication.

Verify in the payer contract and policies whether prior authorization is required. When it has been determined that prior authorization is required, the best time to obtain prior authorization is when the surgical procedure or service is being scheduled. It is imperative that the prior authorization number is reported on the [[claim form]] when billing for pre-authorized procedures.

Typical information required for prior authorization is the following:

- Patient’s name (as it appears on the insurance card)
- Patient’s date of birth
- Insured’s ID number
- [[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]]/[[HCPCS Level II|HCPCS]] Level II code(s)
- ICD-10-CM code(s)
- Location where service is performed
- Ordering physician
- Date of service for the procedure if scheduled

Insurance contracts and policies should be reviewed to determine when a prior authorization is required. If one is required and was not obtained, the service will not be covered by the insurance company. Furthermore, the patient is not responsible for payment of this service if the prior authorization was not obtained. Under these circumstances, the provider is required to [[Write-Off|write off]] the balance.

Many facilities will have an authorizations department. If authorization is not obtained prior to the procedure, some insurance carriers will allow for a retroactive authorization under special circumstances.
