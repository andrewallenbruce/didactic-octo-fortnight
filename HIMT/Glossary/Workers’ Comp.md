# Workers’ Compensation Insurance
*U.S. social insurance system for industrial and work injuries regulated at a state level.*

Workers’ compensation and [[employers’ liability insurance]] is required by law for all business owners who have any employees in most states. Any employer is liable if an employee suffers an injury at work or develops an occupational disease covered by workers’ compensation laws. If an employee is injured, he or she is guaranteed fixed monetary amounts from the employer’s workers’ compensation insurance for medical costs and a percentage of lost wages. This policy also covers the employer for the liabilities the business will suffer due to work-related injuries.

## There are two types of basic workers’ compensation coverage:

- Workers’ compensation insurance provides payments to employees who incur work-related injuries or occupational illnesses. *Referred to as Part One.*
- [[Employers’ liability insurance]] protects the employer against lawsuits due to employment-related injuries and illnesses. *Referred to as Part Two.*

## Types of workers’ compensation benefits include:

- Medical care
- Temporary disability benefits
- Permanent disability benefits
- Vocational rehabilitation services
- Death benefits

This insurance may be purchased through a licensed insurance company or from a state compensation insurance fund. Standard benefits are established by each state.
