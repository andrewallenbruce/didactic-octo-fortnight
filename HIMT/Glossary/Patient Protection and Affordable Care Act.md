# Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) has made a federal mandate for all persons to have minimum essential coverage for themselves and their dependents. If a person does not comply with the law, they will pay a penalty as part of their income tax returns. The ACA allows people to shop and purchase individual plans through the health insurance marketplaces, or exchanges. The exchanges include websites, call centers, and physical locations. People may purchase their insurance from anywhere, but if they purchase through the marketplace, they may be eligible for government subsidies. 

Key provisions of coverage for patients under the ACA include:
- Health plans may no longer limit or deny benefits to children under the age of 19 due to a pre-existing condition.
- Children under the age of 26 may be eligible to be covered under their parent’s health plan: Prior to the ACA, health plans could remove a child at the age of nineteen, sometimes older if they were in college. Under the ACA, most health plans allow coverage to the age of 26, even if they are married, not living with their parents, attending school, not financially dependent on their parent, or eligible to enroll in their employer’s plan.
- Lifetime limits on most benefits are banned: Under the
ACA, lifetime limits are banned on any health plans issued or renewed on or after September 23, 2010. The law also bans annual dollar limits on most covered benefits as of January 1, 2014. A health plan may place annual and lifetime limits on healthcare services that are not
considered essential.
- Appeal rights for patients on denied coverage: The ACA allows for patients to have the right to appeal a health plan’s decision to deny payment for a claim or termination of health coverage. There are both internal and external appeals processes.
- Expanded preventive health services: There are 15 covered preventive services for adults, including cholesterol screenings, colorectal cancer screening, type 2 diabetes screening, and recommended immunizations. There are 22 covered preventive services for women (including pregnant women) including BRCA (breast cancer genetic testing) counseling about genetic testing, breast cancer mammography, cervical cancer screening, osteoporosis screening, and well-woman visits. There are 26 covered services for children including autism screening, depression screening, obesity screening, vision screening, hematocrit/hemoglobin screening, and recommended immunizations.

Individual plans may not deny coverage due to a pre-existing condition. As of January 2014, ACA eliminated pre-existing condition clauses. A person cannot be denied coverage, charged higher premiums, or denied treatment based on their health status or gender. The ACA also requires individual and small-group insured health plans to have certain essential health benefits including hospitalization, prescription drugs, maternity care, newborn
care, mental health services, and preventive care among others.
