Since more and more doctors are being audited by Medicare, Blue Cross, Tricare, Medicaid and others, it’s vitally important that EVERY office be aware of some of the principles of documentation. Yes – these are basic principles – but you may be surprised at how many people who have worked in medical offices for years have no idea what these are.

1.  The medical record must be complete and legible. No – when we say “legible”, we are not referring to the fact that the doctor’s nurse, who has worked with him for 19 years, can decipher it. Legible means the auditor can read it, without any help from the doctor or nurse (or National Security Agency cryptologic analyst). Most auditors use an unofficial “two lay persons” rule in that if two lay people can’t read it – they don’t count it.
    
2.  If the reason for ordering the diagnostic tests is not documented, it must EASILY be inferred from the documentation present.
    
3.  Past and present diagnosis should be accessible to the treating and/or consulting physician.
    
4.  All appropriate health risk factors should be identified (not just some – but ALL)
    
5.  The CPT and ICD-10 codes on the claim form are required to be supported by documentation in the progress notes.
    
6.  The documentation should include the following:
    

1.  Reason for the encounter. (chief complaint) “Why are you here” is a question that should be asked by the nurse or aide that is taking the patient to the exam room. Terms like “follow-up” or “meds refill” is not a clear chief complaint. Why is the patient here for meds follow-up? If they are here because of their diabetes medicine, list diabetes as the chief complaint. If they are here for follow-up, then specify what condition is being followed up.
    
2.  Relevant history, physical exam findings and prior diagnostic test results
    
3.  Assessment, clinical impression of diagnosis, and
    
4.  Date and legible identity of the provider.
    

If you are still writing SOAP notes, you are probably NOT meeting the 95 or 97 guidelines, although you may be meeting the 2021 rules. We recommend you adopt a template system or an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system.

Speaking of the 95 and 97 guidelines…. About 26 years ago, several Medicare carrier directors made announcements that they require bullets be used to identify the exam elements with the 95 guidelines. This is extremely confusing and disconcerting to certified coders around the nation. Most have believed that the “guidelines” were more than guidelines. Most have felt they were the final requirement or rule. Per CMS, 19 years ago, the guidelines are not set in stone. The carriers can alter their own requirements as they deem necessary. We are going to go into much greater detail a little later in this book as to what is required in E&M documentation.

Medicare General Documentation Pointers

Medicare published the following pointers for documentation:

-   Medicare expects the documentation to be generated during the time of service or shortly thereafter.
    
-   Delayed entries within a reasonable time frame (24-48 hrs.) are acceptable for purposes of clarification, error correction, the addition of information not initially available, and if certain unusual circumstances prevented the generation of the note at the time of service.
    
-   The medical record cannot be altered. Errors must be legibly corrected so that the reviewer can draw an inference as to their origin. These corrections or additions must be dated, preferably timed, and legibly signed or initialed.
    
-   Every note stands alone, i.e., the performed services must be documented at the outset.
    
-   All notes should be dated, preferably timed, and signed by the author. In the office setting, initials are acceptable if they clearly identify the author.
    
-   Delayed written explanations will be considered for purposes of clarification only. They cannot be used to add and authenticate services billed and not documented at the time of service or to retrospectively substantiate medical necessity. For that, the medical record must stand on its own with the original entry corroborating that the service was rendered and was medically necessary.
    
-   All entries must be legible to another reader to a degree that a meaningful review can be conducted.
    
-   If the signature is not legible and does not identify the author, a printed version should be also recorded.
    

As it stands, you can and should make documentation addendums, but make sure your addendum is dated on the date you create the addendum. If an audit has already been initiated, we do not recommend you change your coding records in any way – although addenda can still be made to clarify any confusion.

2021 E&M RULES

For the first time since 1997, we have a new set of rules regarding the level of code selection. We have, this year, one set of rules for office visit codes 99202-99215 (2021 rules) and we will continue to use the 1995/1997 rules for all other E&M codes (initial and subsequent hospital, nursing home, home visits, ALF visits, etc.). Everyone expects CMS and the AMA to make the 2021 rules universal on all E&M codes in 2022, but we have to wait to see what they do later this year.

The 2021 rules for codes 99202-99215 no longer require the history or exam be bullet-counted to help determine the level of service code to be billed. It is still expected that the medical provider documents the appropriate history and exam to not only help support the medical necessity but also to maintain continuity of care. The difference is that we will no longer be counting the bullets of history of present illness, review of systems, past, family, social history, exam systems or body areas and exam elements. The 2021 rules dictate that the highest level of code supported either by time or by medical decision making selects the code level. Yes, this is much less complicated than the 95/97 rules.

While the other E&M services will still require the 2 of 3 (for established patients) components of history, exam and medical decision making, the 2021 rules for the office visit codes do not. Providers can use whichever method—MDM or time—that is most beneficial for each visit.

Why is this happening? You can thank President Trump for this one. In 2017, he created the Patients Over Paperwork Initiative and this change should relieve medical providers of about 162 hours a year of paperwork. Wow! That equates out to about 45 minutes a day of less paperwork for most providers. Unfortunately, too many OCD managers and administrators do not grasp this concept and they will do their best to have the doctors, NPs and PAs continue to spend unnecessary time on documenting the way they have for decades. Change does not come easily to some people. So, whether you liked President Trump or not, this relaxation of documentation requirements came directly from him.

Most providers, once they learn how to properly document the medical decision making will discover that the medical decision making will usually give them a higher level of code than the time will, if they are adept at documenting. This is something that the managers and coders should be encouraging their physicians, NPs and PAs to improve on. The difference in income can be extremely beneficial to most practices by learning how to document with the new guidelines.

Along with the new rules also arrived new times for each office visit code and new medical decision-making guidelines, as well as new rules and codes regarding prolonged services. Regardless of which rules you use; the medical necessity will still be the overarching criterion for determining the level of service.

E&M Chief Complaint

A concise statement describing the symptom, problem, condition, diagnosis or other factor that is the reason for the encounter, usually stated in the patient's words. My understanding is that this can be documented by the nurse, aide, assistant or physician.

First, let’s discuss WHO can document the chief complaint. Prior to 2018, many people believed only the doctor or medical practitioner could document the chief complaint. To correct that misbelief, CMS clearly added in the November 2018 Federal Register that ANYONE can document the chief complaint.

What IS important is that the chief complaint be clearly inferred or documented in the medical record. Without it—you may find that the visit is denied as being a routine physical or not medically necessary.

For example, I did a practice analysis for a 4 doctor Internal Medicine group. Several of the progress notes only said, “Here for follow-up”, so I had to see which diagnosis were actually treated. The patient had diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, so at first, I thought it would be easy to derive a chief complaint—but I was wrong.

The doctor had not ordered ANY lab tests on that visit (in spite of the fact that it had been 4 months since the previous visit, and we all know that Medicare wants labs on patients every 3 months when they have these conditions). The doctor said in the notes that the patient was “at goal” on all 3 conditions and did not address them in the treatment plan. No medications were changed or even shown reviewed.

The doctor did not order any diagnostics on this visit, such as ABI for the patient - so I had to advise the doctor that a Medicare auditor would probably deny the claim.

It’s important to understand that a Medicare auditor will be looking for the medical necessity of not only the visit – but also whether the level of visit was commensurate with the type of problem that is affected by the chief complaint.

“Even if a ‘complete’ note is generated, only the MEDICALLY REASONABLE AND NECESSARY SERVICES for the condition of the particular patient at the TIME OF THE ENCOUNTER AS DOCUMENTED can be considered when selecting the appropriate level of the E&M service.”

Every visit code from new patient to established patient requires a chief complaint and without one, you are probably looking at a preventive medicine visit instead of a sick visit.

Also – be aware that the chief complaint may be written as one thing by the nurse or M.A. or whomever brings the patient into the room and documents the chief complaints – but may be changed by the physician when the TRUE reason for the visit is known. You may ask if I’m implying that patients may lie from time to time, and I’m saying - yes, they do. Take, for instance, the 67-year-old Medicare patient that tells the medical assistant (while she is taking the vitals) that he’s there to talk to the doctor about his arthritis in his right arm and may even hold it gently or cradle it like it hurts.

When the physician walks into the room, the patient thrusts it out and shakes the doctor’s hand vigorously and explains that he’s there for the little blue pills to improve his sex life. If asked, he will explain that he couldn’t be expected to “tell that young filly what I really want, as that would be embarrassing”. By the way, if this happens, doctor – it is up to you to do the right thing and how you ask the question will determine whether the patient will be paying for this visit out of his pocket or whether Medicare will.

If you ask him if he is having a sexual dysfunction or impotence problem and he says “no – I just want it for more opportunities to enjoy sex”, then the patient will be paying for the visit in full and Medicare will not be paying a penny towards it. Medicare doesn’t cover visits to ask for recreational prescriptions.

Medicare does pay for sexual dysfunction or impotence as a chief complaint or diagnosis – so you may want to make sure to ask that question of your patient. If they insist that they “have no problems”, then pull out the ABN (Advanced Beneficiary Notice) and have the patient sign it at the beginning of the visit, acknowledging that the patient will be paying for this medically unnecessary visit, as the office visit would be payable under different circumstances and an ABN is required if you wish to be paid. We’ll discuss ABNs in more detail, later in this book.

Now, for a surprise. If your medical provider only renders services in office or via telehealth and does not go to the hospital, nursing home, patient home, Assisted Living facility or anywhere else, you may as well jump on to page 119, since the next 18 pages deals with E&M documentation requirements in those places of service.

E&M HPI

Prior to 2019, CMS required the HPI be documented by the physician, but today anyone can obtain it and document it. The question then arises as to what is HPI and what does each of the different elements of the HPI encompass. Here are some definitions of the elements of the HPI.

-   Location: Defined as a place where something is or could be located; (DUHH!) This one is easy. Most complaints refer to a specific area of the body that hurts, creaks, or has an injury, bump, or just plain isn't functioning properly. Some of the more common examples: headache, abdominal pain, sore throat, nasal congestion, knee swelling, laceration to the finger, burning in the left hand. Not every history will always state a location.  
      
    
-   Quality: An inherent or distinguishing characteristic; a property. Pain may be described as dull, stabbing, sharp, radiating or throbbing. A patient that is coughing up sputum may describe the color, such as red-tinged, or green or yellow. A laceration may be described as jagged or straight, a sore throat may be described as scratchy. A headache may be described as pounding or constant.  
      
    
-   Severity: The state or quality of being severe. Pain is frequently measured on a scale of 1-10, with 10 as the highest. This is an indication of the severity of the pain. You will note from the definition, that severity itself is considered a "quality". The questions one might ask is "just how bad is that scratchy throat," or you might read statements such as "he had so much trouble (with coughing and choking) that he got very frightened." On the opposite side, you may see "the patient feels really well". Severity may also be measured in comparison to previously experienced illness or injury, or even different stages of the current complaint  
      
    
-   Duration: Continuance or persistence in time. How long has this problem, symptom or illness been present? Perhaps it just came on three days ago or perhaps it has been hurting for six months?  
      
    
-   Timing: Regularity of recurrence: Maybe it happens every week, every month, when the weather changes, once a year, etc. The patient has nausea and vomiting in the morning. Other statements such as "seldom" or "frequently" when used to describe the regularity of the recurrence may be counted toward timing.  
      
    
-   Context: The circumstances in which an event occurs; a setting Context seems to be the one descriptor that has given auditors the most trouble. Look for statements that describe how a complaint occurred. "Injuries incurred in a freakish lawnmower racing accident", or "while I was jumping nude on the trampoline", or “flying my kite on the roof during a thunderstorm", or "yelling at the television during the world Tiddlywinks competition”, or “playing the banjo outside the neighborhood Rappers bar”, etc.  
      
    
-   Modifying Factors: Factor is described as anything that actively contributes to or modifies the progression of the symptom, such as “it helped when I took 11 aspirin”, or “the pain worsened when I would hit my head against the wall” or “I lost all feelings in my body when I stuck my tongue on the car battery” or “sitting in the hot tub made my pain go away – until my wife found out that I wasn’t alone in the tub and then the pain came back”. In some cases, a patient may have received care from other physicians or practitioners such as a Chiropractor or Naturalist, etc…. The treatment or care provided by these professionals may indeed be a modifying factor for today's chief complaint.  
      
    
-   Associated Signs and Symptoms: A characteristic sign or indication of the existence of something else: An indication that there is a change from normal function, sensation, or appearance. Patients who describe the scratchy throat with nasal congestion and low-grade fevers are describing not only the chief complaint, but also, the associated signs and symptoms. Usually, these signs and symptoms are volunteered by the patient and can be counted.
    

History of Present Illness (HPI)

As everyone knows, one of the 3 basic components of an E&M is the HPI. Although it is possible to bill an established patient visit while only documenting the Exam and MDM, all 3 components are required for a new patient.

-   LOCATION: where
    
-   SEVERITY: how bad
    
-   ASSOC S&S: what else
    
-   CONTEXT: night-time worse?
    
-   TIMING: migraine 3 times a week
    
-   DURATION: for hours
    
-   QUALITY: limits my ability to drive
    
-   MODIFYING FACTORS: worse when stressed
    

Since all 3 components (history, exam and medical decision making) are required for consultations (yes – non-Medicare plans still pay for consultations), emergency room visits, initial inpatient hospital and initial skilled nursing visits – you need to make sure that your history is well documented on every visit as you do not know when it may be the history of present illness that results in you being down-coded or in having your level of care supported by the HPI. History consists of the HPI (History of Present Illness), Review of Systems (ROS) and PFSH (Past, Family, Social History).

Review of Systems (ROS)

One dictionary identifies it as a “system-by-system review of the body functions”. The Review of Systems is usually begun during the history portion of the visit and completed during the examination, as the physical findings prompt additional questions.

Unlike the HPI, the ROS can be obtained and documented by anyone (per CMS, Medicare and the pointy headed auditors). In fact, many offices have the PATIENT complete a review of system form instead of having the nurse or physician do it. When you consider that the physician’s time is worth more than $460 per hour (at least – that is what their time SHOULD be generating in collections), and the nurse’s time is worth more than $15.00 an hour (or whatever you’re paying your assistant), then it is logical to have the patient complete the form. You can download a free Symptom Survey on the donself.com website and modify it (it’s in Microsoft Word and PDF) to whatever you want and then have the patients complete it as your Review of Systems.

Note – even though the patient may complete the entire form, with positives and negatives, you can only count the RELEVANT items towards the points you need for the Review of Systems. If it’s not relevant - then we cannot count it towards the ROS, PFSH or even the exam, as relevancy is paramount when being audited. So, you download the form and you modify it and you have the patient complete it and you realize that you now have a patient that has marked every area with high severity and you only have a 15-minute visit – so what do you do? This is where discipline comes into necessity for the physician or non-physician practitioner.

You need to explain to the patient that you’ll concentrate today’s visit on the chief complaint, but that you see that you need to schedule the patient for an extended 30-minute visit within the next week or so to address the other problems. This would also be a great time to pre-order the clinical lab and diagnostic tests that you’ll need, so that you can use that next appointment to go over the results as well.

While we’re not attorneys, I have a feeling that would probably cover your medical-legal obligations when the patient brings up the fact that they are a train wreck.

Now – with this in mind, what is the requirement for Review of Systems (ROS) for each level of office visit? You’ll notice in the E&M documentation requirements (also downloadable on the www.donself.com website), that the

-   level 3 outpatient/office visit requires 2-9 ROS for a new patient, but only 1 Review of System for an established patient.
    
-   A level 4 visit requires 10 ROS for a new patient, but only 2 to 9 for an established patient, and
    
-   Level 5 office visit requires 10 (again) for a new or established patient.
    

The survey form at www.donself.com lists the following System areas and areas within them include:

-   CONSTITUTIONAL: fatigue, hyperactive, restless, sleepiness, insomnia, dizziness
    
-   EMOTIONAL: depression, anxiety, mood swings, irritability, forgetfulness

Remember that you will not be penalized for documenting too much – but you can definitely be penalized for not documenting enough.

ROS – Non-Contributory

“All ROS noncontributory” does not give us the ROS needed to support level 3, 4 or 5 visits. This was recently supported in a letter by a Medicare medical director, who said: “Bogus histories and physicals are created in one of 6 ways.

1.  A physician will dictate (or write) under family history, social history, or review of systems, the word, "non-contributory," although he/she never asked any questions about these components.
    
2.  If there is a transcription service, the transcriber will type "non-contributory," even though nothing was dictated.
    
3.  Voice recognition computer programs will either add "noncontributory" or even create "negative/normal" as descriptions for physical findings that were also not mentioned.
    
4.  "WNL" for "Within Normal Limits" will be noted (unfortunately, this usually stands for "We Never Looked").
    
5.  A physician may use a "canned" dictation:
    
6.  A physician may abuse the cutting and pasting functions of word processors to create "documentation."
    

These nonexistent histories and physicals are a problem:

-   First, it is pathetic medical care that will not accurately reflect what the patient’s true condition was on the date of service, and
    
-   Second, the services being billed were not done. So, this is rightfully considered fraud by every auditor that would ever look at it.
    

There are four advantages of using the Symptom Survey form from www.donself.com and having EVERY patient complete the form on EVERY VISIT (new & established).

1.  You obtain enough ROS to support t the level you accurately billed, in case you’re ever audited,
    
2.  You learn more about your patient than you would normally learn by asking questions, because you will forget questions occasionally. I’m fond of saying that there have only been two men who ever walked on water and one of them sank. This implies that there was only one perfect man and that was Jesus. Every one of the rest of us humans will make mistakes (if you doubt that you do – just ask your spouse). During a normal visit, the physician may have 6 to 9 minutes’ face to face with the patient and they will forget to ask or note or document something on just about every patient. When they are seeing that patient, they are not thinking ONLY of that patient, but also of the last patient who just left, about whether they have a pharmaceutical rep bringing lunch, whether their son’s school play is this Thursday or is it next Thursday, whether the office manager made the hotel reservation for next week’s medical conference, etc.… By having the form completed by the patient, you’ll learn more about the patient than if you’re just asking questions.
    
3.  The third reason is that you will see that many of your patients have the medical necessity that necessitates you ordering some diagnostic and clinical tests – and that is a good thing. Since the reimbursement for many diagnostic tests and just about every clinical lab test have been increasing every year since 2001 (while many procedures have seen decreases), it helps the practice when the physician is ordering diagnostic and clinical tests as they should – if the practice is smart enough to be doing many of them in-house. There is a true financial benefit to the patients completing these forms, resulting in the practice increasing income by performing medically necessary testing in the clinic.
    
4.  Better medical care is achieved in a couple of ways. One is that the physician is screening for what could appear to be asymptomatic problems today, because not all patients will remember to bring up problems as they are in your office that could indicate something more serious. The second part of this is that the tests that will be run due to the medical necessity will allow the physician to identify and treat possible severe problems that are being missed by other physicians. For instance, per the National Institute of Health, (publication 06-5835), 33% of patients over 50 with heart disease have Peripheral Artery Disease as well. The problem is that most primary care physicians and other specialists are missing the symptoms and not diagnosing the P.A.D. until the patient must have an amputation. Even the 2012 PQRS (126) states, “in people with diabetes, 22.8% have foot problems including amputations and numbness compared to 10% of non-diabetics.
    

It also says, “Over the age of 40 years old, 30% of people with diabetes have loss of sensation in their feet”. So – by routinely asking your patients about numbness, tingling, burning, coldness in their feet, etc… on the survey – you may be helping to capture P.A.D. early enough in it’s progression that you can save a toe, a foot or even a life.

Past, Family, Social History (PFSH)

A patient’s history is pretty self-explanatory, but should usually include relevant previous surgeries, injuries, illnesses, or treatments.

Family History should include a review of medical events in the patient's family that may include significant data about the health status of the immediate family members (parents, siblings, and children) or their cause of death of specific diseases related to problems identified in the chief complaint or history of the present illness, and/or diseases of family members which may be hereditary or place the patient at risk.

A social history is expected to include a review of past and current activities that includes relevant information about marital status, current or past employment, use of drugs including alcohol, and tobacco, diet or exercise habits, level of education, sexual history; and other relevant social factors.

Remember that each progress note stands alone, so it is not advisable for a physician or practitioner to notate “reviewed PFSH” as that doesn’t give the auditor any help in crediting the provider for the PFSH elements.

Why not have your nurses or medical assistants or whomever it is that takes the patient into the exam room and gets the vitals to ask every patient (if you’re not going to use the Symptom Survey) a couple of relevant PFSH questions, such as:

-   Have any of your family members had heart disease?
    
-   Have any of your family members had diabetes?
    
-   Have you recently started an exercise program or diet?
    
-   Have you recently stopped smoking and threatened others with a sharp object?
    
-   Is anyone else in your family crazy or nutty as a loon?
    

By asking these questions, you’ll be gaining information that may or may not be relevant to their chief complaint or medical decision making, so we recommend you get your staff accustomed to asking.

It is important to note that to count them towards the PFSH, the questions need to be relevant to the problems that you are treating today or that you are taking into consideration for therapy or medical management. For instance, family questions could include completely non-relevant or significant data, such as “how many children does your second cousin have”. While that is not relevant, perhaps if the patient is found to have a pulmonary problem, a relevant one may be “Does anyone else in your parent’s immediate family such as their sisters or brothers have any history of pulmonary dysfunction?”

As an example, in our family, I was unaware that my mother probably died from Pulmonary Fibrosis instead of COPD, and to most – that may not seem like a big thing, since either way, she is gone.

But – where it may become a big thing to know the extended family history is if your family has something that turns out to be genetic, such as the fact that every one of her 6 siblings may have or had the same thing, and it has prematurely killed all of them. Now – the relevance comes in for the PFSH as that has a very likely chance of affecting myself and my children as well as my grandchildren. Would your physician think to ask that question of aunts and uncles? I don’t know – but perhaps they should, and that can make a difference between mediocre and good medical care.

Exam Body Areas

There are 10 body areas that can be examined, including:

1.  Head
    
2.  Extremity
    
3.  Neck
    
4.  Abdomen
    
5.  Chest
    
6.  Genital/Post.
    
7.  Back
    

Ok, you’re thinking “Don said ten, but there are only 7, so perhaps he’s hit his head a few too many times?” Some of your patients may come in with only 1, 2 or 3 extremities, but if they come in with 4 – then you have 10 body areas that can be examined, as each extremity examined gets counted.

Exam Elements

Ok – this is the fun area. You have lots of elements that can be counted and if you are using a template (which is legal, per CMS, HHS and all the other agencies designated with 3 letters), then you should count each element that is indicated with “Within Normal Limits” individually.

(What does Don mean when he says “individually”?) If you are using a template, you must mark each area independently and not just draw a line through several elements as normal or WNL or CMS auditors (and others too, I presume) will not allow credit for those elements.

The very first element area listed is Constitutional and the first one within that area is Appearance. This would normally be “tired, fatigued, in pain, upset, no apparent distress (NAD), energetic, wired, cranky, irritable, excited, angry, ecstatic, etc….

We do NOT recommend you use the words “fat” or “ugly” as the HIPAA laws allow the patient to request to see their own records anytime they wish, and we’re already having enough problems with patients not understanding the abbreviation for “Shortness of Breath” and we do not want to add to the problems.

After appearance, we have the vitals listed, so three vitals – such as “temp, bp, weight” would count as one exam element. If they documented height, respiration and pulse, I believe most auditors would give them credit for a second element as well – but if they do not document at least 3 – you don’t get any element for vitals. Why not have your nurse or whoever is getting the vitals to get all six vitals on every patient visit, as well as the appearance? The other elements do not take a lot of documentation, and sometimes (if they are within normal limits), it may only take a simple checkmark on a template.

Conversely, if the element is NOT within normal limits, you HAVE to write, type or dictate what is abnormal, scary, missing, inflamed, enlarged, reduced, odd, freakish, grotesque, odorous, weird, or just plain… not normal so that the person reading it is very clear as to what YOU saw.

By now, I shouldn’t have to point out that the TRUE benefit of documentation is not the auditors or payment or to satisfy the pointy headed money people. The real reason we do it is so that a healthcare professional will be able to make their medical decisions in the future based on what you observed or what you treated or what conclusions you came to.

Sometimes – that future healthcare provider will be you looking at your own records and it will help you in how you care for the patient. So- the more information you document, the more accurate it will be. Overall, it shouldn’t take a physician more than a minute or two to document a typical 99231 or 99232 and less than 7 minutes to document a typical 99233 if they are truly smart about how they do it. Of course, after getting a good Electronic Medical Record, it may take less time than they realize.

Using Time To Determine Level of Code

Once more, this year’s time rules are different for office visit codes 99202-99215 or telehealth services than they are for other E&M visits. The office visit or telehealth code time requirements follow the 2021 rules and the other codes still use the 95/97 rules regarding time.

OFFICE VISIT OR TELEHEALTH – TIME

It is important to understand how to use time to code a visit. With the new rules, total time is considered face-to-face and non-face-to-face on the date of the encounter by the “reporting” practitioner. We recommend you adopt new habits of documenting:

-   Pre-time: “Spent 4 minutes reviewing patient chart”
    
-   During: “Spent 18 minutes with patient and family”
    
-   Post: “Spent 7 minutes documenting notes and ordering prescriptions”
    

You do not have to document start-stop times (yet), but if you break it out as we’ve shown above, it makes it difficult for an auditor to challenge it. To document, state the total time spent that day and summarize the services performed. It’s important to note that the criteria for time:

-   Does not require the patient to be in the office
    
-   Excludes time spent by the clinical staff
    
-   Excludes time spent performing procedures
    
-   Includes time spent by Non-Physician Practitioners (NPPs) when both practitioners see a patient, but can only count one person per minute.
    

We have new times for Office E&M visits:

  

  

99211

-

99202

15 - 29 min

99212

10 - 19 min

99203

30 - 44 min

99213

20 - 29 min

99204

45 - 59 min

99214

30 - 39 min

99205

60 - 74 min

99215

40 - 54 min

Note that while in 2019 and years earlier, commercial (CPT) claims and Medicare differed in that CPT said nearest time and Medicare said “minimum” time, they all say “minimum” now. So – you no longer get to “round” to the nearest time increment with CPT rules.

You’ll also notice that 99201 is gone. It has been deleted. AMA: “Use 99202 in place of 99201” at https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/2020-04/e-m-office-visit-changes.pdf

Once more, the appropriate level of E/M service is based on the following:

-   The level of the MDM as defined for each service; or
    
-   The total time for E/M services performed on the date of the encounter by the medical provider(s).
    

If you were billing for telehealth visits after April 6th of 2020, you are already used to using these rules for determining the level of service. Medicare telehealth visit rules were based on these same 2 criteria throughout most of 2020 and still are this year.

Remember, if you document a moderate level of Medical Decision Making, you can bill a 99204 or 99214, even if the time spent was much less than those shown on the graph. You get to select the higher of the two choices and time will not reduce the level of code supported by the MDM.

OTHER E&M VISITS BASED ON TIME

For other E&M’s. you only count time if more than 50% of the visit is spent in counseling and/or coordination of care for a medically justified reason. In those cases, then you do not have to worry about documenting the history, exam & medical decision making, as long as the physician or provider appropriately documents the total time, time spent on the counseling and/or coordination of care and what was discussed. This happens often and in many; it may happen multiple times a day. The CPT book and Medicare lists the “normal” times for office/outpatient visits as:

As of 2021, Medicare does not require that you document the start-stop times when documenting the counseling/coordination of care, although it may be a good idea to get into the habit so that you cannot be challenged in an audit.

A perfect example of when the visit will be dominated by counseling is when you have a patient that you saw a week ago and clinical lab tests were run on them and today you see them again (hospital, nursing home, home visit) for the results.

You’re not going to do a new history or a new exam, although you will do some new decision making, but the majority of the visit will be counseling. If you’re telling a patient they have diabetes, then you’re spending at least another 15 to 25 minutes going over the diabetes, what it is, how it’s treated, what ramifications they have, what symptoms to watch for, complications, what they can and cannot do, etc.…

You may even be coordinating care with a DME company or a supplier of home glucose testing. The only way you can effectively code that visit is by utilizing the counseling/coordination of care method of billing and that requires you document the total time, the amount of time YOU (the provider) spent with the patient counseling or the time YOU spent coordinating care with another caregiver or supplier or ordering DME, etc.…

You can and should use the counseling and/or coordination of care billing rules with any carrier unless they have posted that they do not ascribe to this, but we’ve yet to see any that have not adopted this type of documentation yet.

Emergency Room codes (99281-99285) do not have normal times associated with them in either the CPT codebook or the Medicare Carrier Manual, so you may not use time to determine the level of coding in the Emergency Department series of coding.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING

Just like the rest of the 2021 rules this year, you need to use the original rules regarding MDM for E&M services outside of the office and use the new MDM rules for the 2021 office visit codes 99202-99215 as well as telehealth coding.

So – what is the difference? The 1995 and 1997 documentation guidelines used very vague descriptions of exactly what medical-decision-making requirements the AMA expected. Consequently, for the 24 years we used them, coders and auditors pretty well agreed on specifics that they assumed the AMA meant. That pretty much became the standards that auditors would use when reviewing the E&M codes for 24 years. This is why it was so easy for an experienced healthcare attorney familiar with the intricacies of coding could win against CMS, OIG, Medicare and other “official” audits. Unfortunately, too many unknowing office managers, attorneys and medical professionals never knew this, which is why they would agree to pay the large fines or recoupments. Now, with the 2021 rules, the MDM is pretty well spelled out.

Of course, even the 2021 rules have already been adjusted partially into 2021 when it comes to which labs can be counted in the data side, etc. We created a sharp little 13-minute webinar on the MDM for 2021 that makes it super easy for a provider or biller to know what is expected. You can watch it at www.donself.com/em and you’ll see it is pretty doggone simple, folks.

Yes – there are some that have made it confusing – but some people will make anything confusing in order to make themselves appear smarter or more educated. The new 2021 rules are definitely much easier than most expect.

When selecting the MDM in 2021, you select the MDM based on the highest 2 of the 3 areas:

1.  Number & complexity of problems addressed during the encounter,
    
2.  Amount and/or complexity of data reviewed & analyzed,
    
3.  Risk of complications and/or morbidity or mortality of patient management.
    

To clarify…Let’s say the Number and Complexity of Problems is Moderate and the Data area is moderate. In that case, you really don’t have to look at the risk area, as you know the level of MDM will be moderate as 2 of the 3 met that level!

On the other hand, let’s say the Number and complexity of problems was Low and the Data area was moderate. In that case, you would need to look at the Risk area to determine the level of MDM.

NUMBER & COMPLEXITY OF PROBLEMS

Whereas the 1995/1997 MDM rules looked for only the diagnosis, the first area of MDM (problems) opens up much more possibilities for the medical provider. A problem is defined by CMS as “a disease, condition, illness, injury, symptom, sign, findings, complaint, and/or other matters addressed during the visit, with or without a diagnosis being established at the time of the visit.” Wow. CMS even went as far as naming the specific areas of “problems”. We have Straightforward, Low, Moderate and High levels of “problems”.

-   Straightforward: This will be one self-limited or minor problem, such as a sprain, common cold, splinter in the finger, URI, measles, etc. No, there is no exhaustive list of what could fall within this category. If it would take care of itself in time, it falls within this selection.
    
-   Low: This could be two self-limited or minor problems or chronic conditions such as controlled diabetic or controlled hypertension, a patient at the specific treatment goals or a problem that is normally minor and self-limiting but not resolving. Also in this category is a condition where full recovery is expected without deterioration.
    
-   Moderate: Typically, this would be an uncontrolled chronic disease such as uncontrolled diabetes or uncontrolled hypertension or even multiple controlled diseases that must be monitored. Also in this category is the illness that is acutely worsening, requiring additional care – but not hospitalization.
    
-   High: This is where you have multiple uncontrolled chronic diseases or an illness or injury with severe progression or severe side effects that have a significant risk of morbidity. If it “may” require hospitalization or if the condition poses a threat to life or body function without treatment, you should be looking at the High level of problems.
    

Remember that the PROBLEMS area only counts those that are actively addressed during the visit!

AMOUNT AND/OR COMPLEXITY OF DATA REVIEWED & ANALYZED

There are four levels in the DATA area: Minimal, Limited, Moderate & Extensive.

1.  Minimal or None: Self-explanatory
    
2.  Limited: (Must meet the requirements of at least 1 of the 2 categories:
    

1.  Category 1: Tests and documents (any combination of 2 from)
    

1.  Review of prior external note(s) from each unique source*;
    
2.  Review of the result(s) of each unique test*; or 
    
3.  Ordering of each unique test*
    

3.  Category 2: Assessment requiring an independent historian(s) (For the categories of independent interpretation of tests and discussion of management or test interpretation, see moderate or high)
    

4.  Moderate: (Must meet the requirements of at least 1 out of 3 categories)
    

1.  Category 1: Tests, documents, or independent historian(s)
    

1.  Any combination of 3 from the following:
    

1.  Review of prior external note(s) from each unique source*;
    
2.  Review of the result(s) of each unique test*;
    
3.  Ordering of each unique test*; or 
    

3.  Assessment requiring an independent historian(s)
    

3.  Category 2: Independent interpretation of tests
    

1.  Independent interpretation of a test performed by another physician/other qualified health care professional (not separately reported); or
    

5.  Category 3: Discussion of management or test interpretation
    

1.  Discussion of management or test interpretation with external physician/other qualified health care professional\appropriate source (not separately reported)
    

6.  Extensive (Must meet the requirements of at least 2 out of 3 categories)

1.  Any combination of 3 from the following:
    
2.  Review of prior external note(s) from each unique source*;
    
3.  Review of the result(s) of each unique test*;
    
4.  Ordering of each unique test*; or
    
5.  Assessment requiring an independent historian(s)

RISK OF COMPLICATIONS AND/OR MORBIDITY OR MORTALITY OF PATIENT MANAGEMENT

That is a mouthful! For those that have been coding for years, relax as this is just about the same as it’s been since 1997. Yes, there are a couple of minor changes, but the overall change is how the risk includes not only the patient’s condition, but also how it is affected by the testing or treatment as well. Just like the other 2 areas, you still have 4 classifications: Minimal, Low, Moderate and High. (Yep – no surprises there!)

So – what does it mean by risk of morbidity affected by testing? Morbidity is another word for “condition of suffering”. A great example is my other father-in-law. His doctor said he wants to do an MRI on him with contrast. The patient is at stage 4 kidney disease, and the surgery the doctor wants to do has minimal chances of slight improvement, but high risk due to putting dye into the patient with kidney disease. I advised him to say no due to the risk of not only the surgery but also the testing itself. Each of the following is the level of risk of morbidity from additional testing or treatment.

-   Minimal Risk 
    
-   Low Risk 
    
-   Moderate Risk:
    

-   RX drug management
    
-   Decision regarding minor surgery with identified patient or procedure risk factors
    
-   Decision regarding elective major surgery without identified procedure risk factors
    
-   Diagnosis or treatment significantly limited by social determinants of health
    

-   High Risk:
    

-   Drug Therapy requiring intensive monitoring for toxicity
    
-   Decision regarding elective major surgery with identified patient or procedure risk factors
    
-   Decision regarding emergency major surgery
    
-   Decision regarding hospitalization
    
-   Decision not to resuscitate or to de-escalate care because of poor prognosis
    

Note: So what is the definition of RX Drug Management? CMS says it is “Prescription drug management" is based on documented evidence that the provider has evaluated the patient's medications as part of a service. This may be a prescription being written or discontinued, or a decision to maintain a current medication/dosage.” What it is not is “I looked at the list of drugs the patient is taking”! It must be a documented decision!

Note: The “Decision regarding hospitalization” does not require the patient to be hospitalized. It means the medical provider made the DECISION whether to or whether not to hospitalize. Of course, to be counted, the medical provider must document what discussion or decision was made regarding hospitalization.

CALCULATING THE MDM

Overall, as I indicated before, it’s pretty simple. Use this table to see how easy it really can be:  
  

CODE

MDM LVL

Num/Cmplx

Amt/Cmpx

RISK

99211

N/A

99204

99214

Moderate

99205

99215

Select the code with the 2nd highest level of MDM. So, if you have a High level of Problems and a Moderate level of Data and a Low level of Risk, you will select the 99204 or 99214. Remember, with the 2021 rules, the only difference between a new patient and an established patient is the code itself.

If you have two moderates and one minimal area, you have a Moderate level of MDM, regardless of how much time was spent. Keep in mind that time can never diminish the level of code if the MDM is higher.
