# Outpatient Code Editor (OCE)
*Software that edits outpatient hospital [[Claim Form|claims]] to detect incorrect billing data and determine if the Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) limit should apply to each claim and reviews each [[HCPCS Level II|HCPCS]] and ICD-10-CM code for validity and coverage.*

## [[National Correct Coding Initiative]]
In August of 2000, [[National Correct Coding Initiative|NCCI]] edits were added to the Outpatient Code Editor (OCE) to assist [[Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC)|MACs]] in processing Part B claims for outpatient hospital services.
