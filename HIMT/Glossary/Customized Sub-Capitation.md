# Customized Sub-Capitation (CSC)
*Managed care plan in which healthcare expenses are funded by insurance coverage; the individual selects one of each type of provider to create a customized insurance premium.*

With a CSC, an individual is given a choice of providers of each type and given sub-[[capitation]] premiums that each provider charges. The individual chooses the providers he or she wants, and a customized premium is made of the sum of the sub-capitation rates for the providers selected. Each provider is paid a fixed amount per month to provide only the care that the individual requires from that provider (subcapitation). The individual can make choices based on provider quality and price.
