# Status Indicators
## A = Active code
These codes are separately paid under the physician fee schedule, if covered. There will be RVUs and payment amounts for codes with this status. The presence of an A indicator doesn’t mean that Medicare has made a national coverage determination regarding the service; MACs remain responsible for coverage decisions in the absence of a national Medicare policy. 
## B = Bundled code
Payment for covered services are always bundled into payment for other services not specified. There will be no RVUs or payment amounts for these codes and no separate payment is ever made. When these services are covered, payment for them is subsumed by the payment for the services to which they are incident (an example is a telephone call from a hospital nurse regarding care of a beneficiary). 
## C = MACs priced code
MACs will establish RVUs and payment amounts for these services, generally on an individual case-by-case basis following review of documentation such as an operative report. 
## E = Excluded from physician fee schedule by regulation
These codes are for items or services that CMS chose to exclude from the fee schedule payment by regulation. No RVUs or payment amounts are shown, and no payment may be made under the fee schedule for these codes. Payment for them, when covered, continues under reasonable charge procedures. 
## I = Not valid for Medicare purposes
Medicare uses another code for reporting of, and payment for, these services. (Code NOT subject to a 90-day grace period.) 
## M = Measurement codes
Used for reporting purposes only. 
## N = Non-covered service
## P = Bundled and excluded codes
There are no RVUs and no payment amounts for these services. No separate payment is made for them under the fee schedule. If the item or service is covered as incident to a physician service and is given on the same day as a physician service, payment for it is bundled into the payment for the physician service to which it is incident (an example is an elastic bandage furnished by a physician incident to a physician service). If the item or service is covered as other than incident to a physician service, it is excluded from the fee schedule (for example, colostomy supplies) and is paid under the other payment provision of the Social Security Act. 
## Q = Therapy functional information code
Used for required reporting purposes only. This indicator is no longer effective beginning with the 2020 fee schedule as of January 1, 2020. 
## R = Restricted coverage
Special coverage instructions apply. 
## T = Paid as only service
These codes are paid only if there are no other services payable under the physician fee schedule billed on the same date by the same provider. If any other services payable under the physician fee schedule are billed on the same date by the same provider, these services are bundled into the physician services for which payment is made. 
## X = Statutory exclusion
These codes represent an item or service that isn’t in the statutory definition of physician services for fee schedule payment purposes. No RVUs or payment amounts are shown for these codes and no payment may be made under the physician fee schedule. (Examples are ambulance services and clinical diagnostic laboratory services.) 

# Global Surgery 
This field gives the postoperative time frames that apply to payment for each surgical procedure or another indicator that describes the applicability of the global concept to the service. 
## 000
Endoscopic or minor procedure with related preoperative and postoperative relative values on the day of the procedure only included in the fee schedule payment amount, evaluation and management services on the day of the procedure generally not payable. 
## 010
Minor procedure with preoperative relative values on the day of the procedure and postoperative relative values during a 10-day postoperative period included in the fee schedule amount; evaluation and management services on the day of the procedure and during this 10-day postoperative period generally not payable. 
## 090
Major surgery with a 1-day preoperative period and 90-day postoperative period included in the fee schedule payment amount. 
## MMM
Maternity codes; usual global period doesn’t apply. 
## XXX
Global concept doesn’t apply. 
## YYY
MAC determines whether global concept applies and establishes postoperative period, if appropriate, at time of pricing.
## ZZZ
Code related to another service and is always included in the global period of the other service. (Note: Physician work is associated with intra-service time and in some instances the post service time.) 

# [[26 - Professional Component | PC]] / TC Indicator
## 0 = Physician service codes
This indicator identifies codes that describe physician services. Examples include visits, consultations, and surgical procedures. The concept of PC or TC doesn’t apply since physician services can’t be split into professional and technical components. Modifiers 26 and TC can’t be used with these codes. The total Relative Value Units (RVUs) include values for physician work, practice expense, and malpractice expense. There are some codes with no work RVUs. 
## 1 = Diagnostic tests or radiology services
This indicator identifies codes that describe diagnostic tests (for example, pulmonary function tests or therapeutic radiology procedures such as radiation therapy). These codes generally have both a professional and technical component. Modifiers 26 and TC can be used with these codes. The total RVUs for codes reported with a 26 modifier include values for physician work, practice expense, and malpractice expense. The total RVUs for codes reported with a TC modifier include values for practice expense and malpractice expense only. The total RVUs for codes reported without a modifier equals the sum of RVUs for both the professional and technical component. 
## 2 = Professional component only codes
This indicator identifies stand alone codes that describe the physician work portion of selected diagnostic tests for which there is an associated code that describes the technical component of the diagnostic test only and another associated code that describes the global test. An example of a professional component only code is 93010, Electrocardiogram, interpretation, and report. Modifiers 26 and TC can’t be used with these codes. The total RVUs for professional component only codes include values for physician work, practice expense, and malpractice expense. 
## 3 = Technical component only codes
This indicator identifies stand alone codes that describe the technical component (such as staff and equipment costs) of selected diagnostic tests for which there is an associated code that describes the professional component of the diagnostic tests only. An example of a technical component code is 93005, Electrocardiogram, tracing only, without interpretation and report. It also identifies codes that are covered only as diagnostic tests and therefore don’t have a related professional code. Modifiers 26 and TC can’t be used with these codes. The total RVUs for technical component only codes include values for practice expense and malpractice expense only. 
## 4 = Global test only codes
This indicator identifies stand alone codes for which there are associated codes that describe: a) the professional component of the test only and b) the technical component of the test only. Modifiers 26 and TC can’t be used with these codes. The total RVUs for global procedure only codes include values for physician work, practice expense, and malpractice expense. The total RVUs for global procedure only codes equal the sum of the total RVUs for the professional and technical components only codes combined. 
## 5 = Incident to codes
This indicator identifies codes that describe services covered incident to a physician’s service when they are given by auxiliary personnel employed by the physician and working under his or her direct supervision. Payment may not be made by MACs for these services when they are given to hospital inpatients or patients in a hospital outpatient department. Modifiers 26 and TC can’t be used with these codes. 
## 6 = Laboratory physician interpretation codes
This indicator identifies clinical laboratory codes for which separate payment for interpretations by laboratory physicians may be made. Actual performance of the tests is paid for under the lab fee schedule. Modifier TC can’t be used with these codes. The total RVUs for laboratory physician interpretation codes include values for physician, work, practice expense, and malpractice expense. 
## 7 = Private practice therapist’s service
Payment may not be made if the service is given to either a beneficiary in a hospital outpatient department or to an inpatient of the hospital by a physical therapist, occupational therapist, or speech-language pathologist in private practice. 
## 8 = Physician interpretation codes
This indicator identifies the professional component of clinical laboratory codes for which separate payment may be made only if the physician interprets an abnormal smear for a hospital inpatient. This applies only to code 85060. No TC billing is recognized because payment for the underlying clinical laboratory test is made to the hospital, generally through the Prospective Payment System (PPS) rate. No payment is recognized for code 85060 furnished to hospital outpatients or non-hospital patients. The physician interpretation is paid through the clinical laboratory fee schedule payment for the clinical laboratory test. 
## 9 = Concept of PC / TC doesn’t apply

# Multiple Procedures ([[Modifier 51 - Multiple Procedures | Modifier 51]]) 
This indicator indicates which payment adjustment rule for multiple procedures applies to the service. 
## 0
### No payment adjustment rules for multiple procedures apply
If the procedure is reported on the same day as another procedure, payment is based on the lower of: (a) the actual charge or (b) the fee schedule amount for the procedure. 
## 1
### Standard payment adjustment rules in effect before 01/01/96 for multiple procedures apply
In the 1996 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Database (MPFSDB), this indicator only applied to codes with procedure status of D. If a procedure is reported on the same day as another procedure with an indicator of 1, 2, or 3, Medicare ranks the procedures by the fee schedule amount and the appropriate reduction to this code is applied (100%, 50%, 25%, 25%, 25%, and by report). MACs base payment on the lower of: (a) the actual charge or (b) the fee schedule amount reduced by the appropriate percentage. 
## 2
### Standard payment adjustment rules for multiple procedures apply
If the procedure is reported on the same day as another procedure with an indicator of 1, 2, or 3, MACs rank the procedures by fee schedule amount and apply the appropriate reduction to this code (100%, 50%, 50%, 50%, 50%, and by report). MACs base payment on the lower of: (a) the actual charge or (b) the fee schedule amount reduced by the appropriate percentage.
## 3
### Special rules for multiple endoscopic procedures apply if procedure is billed with another endoscopy in the same family (that is, another endoscopy that has the same base procedure)
The base procedure for each code with this indicator is identified in field 31G of the Form CMS-1500 or its electronic equivalent claim. The multiple endoscopy rules apply to a family before ranking the family with other procedures performed on the same day (for example, if multiple endoscopies in the same family are reported on the same day as endoscopies in another family or on the same day as a non-endoscopic procedure). If an endoscopic procedure is reported with only its base procedure, the base procedure isn’t separately paid. Payment for the base procedure is included in the payment for the other endoscopy. 
## 4
### Diagnostic imaging services subject to MPPR methodology
TC of diagnostic imaging services subject to a 50% reduction of the second and subsequent imaging services furnished by the same physician (or by multiple physicians in the same group practice, for example, same group National Provider Identifier [NPI]) to the same beneficiary on the same day, effective for services July 1, 2010, and after. PC of diagnostic imaging services are subject to a 25% payment reduction of the second and subsequent imaging services effective January 1, 2012.
## 5-6-7 = N/A
Multiple procedure indicator 5 isn’t included in this file, since the indicator represents the therapy multiple procedure payment reduction which never applies to professional service revenue codes. Multiple procedure indicators 6 and 7 aren’t included in this file, since in these cases the reduction only applies to technical component services. On CAH claims, technical components are paid on a cost basis and so aren’t subject to the reductions. 
## 9 = Concept doesn’t apply
Codes with RVUs equal to zero aren’t included in the payment indicator file. These codes may have multiple procedure indicators not shown. 
# Bilateral Surgery Indicator (Modifier 50) 
This field gives an indicator for services subject to a payment adjustment. 
## 0
### 150% payment adjustment for bilateral procedures doesn’t apply
If a procedure is reported with modifier 50 or with modifiers RT and LT, Medicare bases payment for the 2 sides on the lower of: 
1. the total actual charge for both sides or
2. 100% of the fee schedule amount for a single code. 
	- Example: The fee schedule amount for code XXXXX is $125. The physician reports code XXXXX-LT with an actual charge of $100 and XXXXX-RT with an actual charge of $100. Payment would be based on the fee schedule amount ($125) since it’s lower than the total actual charges for the left and right sides ($200). The bilateral adjustment is inappropriate for codes in this category because of (a) physiology or anatomy or (b) because the code descriptor specifically states that it’s a unilateral procedure and there is an existing code for the bilateral procedure.
## 1
### 150% payment adjustment for bilateral procedures applies
If a code is billed with the bilateral modifier or is reported twice on the same day by any other means (such as with RT and LT modifiers or with a 2 in the units field), payment is based for these codes when reported as bilateral procedures on the lower of: (a) the total actual charge for both sides or (b) 150% of the fee schedule amount for a single code. If code is reported as a bilateral procedure and is reported with other procedure codes on the same day, the bilateral adjustment is applied before applying any applicable multiple procedure rules. 
2 = 150% payment adjustment for bilateral procedure doesn’t apply
RVUs are already based on the procedure providers perform as a bilateral procedure. If a procedure is reported with modifier 50 or is reported twice on the same day by any other means (such as with RT and LT modifiers with a 2 in the units field), payment is based for both sides on the lower of (a) the total actual charges by the physician for both sides or (b) 100% of the fee schedule amount for a single code. Example: The fee schedule amount for code YYYYY is $125. The physician reports code YYYYY-LT with an actual charge of $100 and YYYYY-RT with an actual charge of $100. Payment would be based on the fee schedule amount ($125) since it is lower than the total actual charges for the left and right sides ($200). The RVUs are based on a bilateral procedure because: (a) the code descriptor specifically states that the procedure is bilateral; (b) the code descriptor states that the procedure may be performed either unilaterally or bilaterally; or (c) the procedure is usually performed as a bilateral procedure. 
## 3 = The usual payment adjustment for bilateral procedures doesn’t apply
If procedure is reported with modifier 50 or is reported for both sides on the same day by any other means (such as with RT and LT modifiers or with a 2 in the units field), Medicare bases payment for each side or organ or site of a paired organ on the lower of: (a) the actual charge for each side or (b) 100% of the fee schedule amount for each side. If procedure is reported as a bilateral procedure and with other procedure codes on the same day, the fee schedule amount for a bilateral procedure is determined before applying any applicable multiple procedure rules. Services in this category are generally radiology procedures or other diagnostic tests which aren’t subject to the special payment rules for other bilateral procedures. 
## 9 = Concept doesn’t apply
# Assistant at Surgery
This field gives an indicator for services where an assistant at surgery is never paid.
## 0
Payment restriction for assistants at surgery applies to this procedure unless supporting documentation is submitted to establish medical necessity.
## 1
Statutory payment restriction for assistants at surgery applies to this procedure. Assistants at surgery may not be paid. 
## 2
Payment restriction for assistants at surgery don’t apply to this procedure. Assistants at surgery may be paid. 
## 9 
Concept doesn’t apply.
Co-Surgeons (Modifier 62) 
This field gives an indicator for services for which 2 surgeons, each in a different specialty, may be paid. 0 = Co-surgeons not permitted for this procedure. 1 = Co-surgeons could be paid. Supporting documentation is required to establish medical necessity of 2 surgeons for the procedure. 2 = Co-surgeons permitted. No documentation is required if 2 specialty requirements are met. 9 = Concept doesn’t apply. Team Surgeons (Modifier 66) This field gives an indicator for services for which team surgeons may be paid. 0 = Team surgeons not permitted for this procedure. 1 = Team surgeons could be paid. Supporting documentation is required to establish medical necessity of a team; paid by report. 2 = Team surgeons permitted; pay by report. 9 = Concept doesn’t apply. Physician Supervision of Diagnostic Procedures This field is for use in post payment review. 01 = Procedure must be performed under the general supervision of a physician. 02 = Procedure must be performed under the direct supervision of a physician. 03 = Procedure must be performed under the personal supervision of a physician.

(Diagnostic imaging procedures performed by a Registered Radiologist Assistant (RRA) who is certified and registered by The American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT) or a Radiology Practitioner Assistant (RPA) who is certified by the Certification Board for Radiology Practitioner Assistants (CBRPA), and is authorized to furnish the procedure under state law, may be performed under direct supervision.) 04 = Physician supervision policy doesn’t apply when procedure is furnished by a qualified, independent psychologist or a clinical psychologist. Otherwise the procedure must be performed under the general supervision of a physician. 05 = Not subject to supervision when furnished personally by a qualified audiologist, physician, or non physician practitioner. Direct supervision by a physician is required for those parts of the test that may be furnished by a qualified technician when appropriate to the circumstances of the test. 06 = Procedure must be personally performed by a physician or a Physical Therapist (PT) who is certified by the American Board of Physical Therapy Specialties (ABPTS) as a qualified electrophysiological clinical specialist and is permitted to provide the procedure under state law. Procedure may also be performed by a PT with ABPTS certification without physician supervision. 21 = Procedure may be performed by a technician with certification under general supervision of a physician. Otherwise the procedure must be performed under direct supervision of a physician. Procedure may also be performed by a PT with ABPTS certification without physician supervision 22 = May be performed by a technician with on-line real-time contact with a physician. 66 = May be personally performed by a physician or by a PT with ABPTS certification and certification in this specific procedure. 6A = Supervision standards for level 66 apply; in addition, the PT with ABPTS certification may personally supervise another PT, but only the PT with ABPTS certification may bill. 77 = Procedure must be performed by a PT with ABPTS certification (TC & PC) or by a PT without certification under direct supervision of a physician (TC & PC), or by a technician with certification under general supervision of a physician (TC only; PC always physician). 7A = Supervision standards for level 77 apply; in addition, the PT with ABPTS certification may personally supervise another PT, but only the PT with ABPTS certification may bill. 09 = Concept doesn’t apply. Diagnostic Imaging Family Indicator For services effective January 1, 2011, and after, family indicators 01 - 11 won’t be populated. 01 = Family 1 Ultrasound (Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis – Non Obstetrical) 02 = Family 2 CT and CTA (Chest/Thorax/ Abd/Pelvis) 03 = Family 3 CT and CTA (Head/Brain/Orbit/Maxillofacial/Neck)

04 = Family 4 MRI and MRA (Chest/Abd/Pelvis) 05 = Family 5 MRI and MRA (Head/Brain/Neck) 06 = Family 6 MRI and MRA (Spine) 07 = Family 7 CT (Spine) 08 = Family 8 MRI and MRA (Lower Extremities) 09 = Family 9 CT and CTA (Lower Extremities) 10 = Family 10 Mr and MRI (Upper Extremities and Joints) 11 = Family 11 CT and CTA (Upper Extremities) 88 = Subject to the reduction of the TC diagnostic imaging (effective for services January 1, 2011, and after). Subject to the reduction of the PC diagnostic imaging (effective for services January 1, 2012, and after) 99 = Concept Doesn’t Apply---

# [[Medicare Physician Fee Schedule|MPFS]] Status Indicators
## A = Active code
These codes are separately paid under the physician fee schedule, if covered. There will be [[Relative Value Unit (RVU)]] and payment amounts for codes with this status. The presence of an A indicator doesn’t mean that [[Medicare]] has made a [[National Coverage Determination]] regarding the service; MACs remain responsible for coverage decisions in the absence of a national Medicare policy. 
## B = Bundled code
Payment for covered services are always bundled into payment for other services not specified. There will be no RVUs or payment amounts for these codes and no separate payment is ever made. When these services are covered, payment for them is subsumed by the payment for the services to which they are incident (an example is a telephone call from a hospital nurse regarding care of a [[Beneficiary]]). 
## C = MACs priced code
MACs will establish RVUs and payment amounts for these services, generally on an individual case-by-case basis following review of documentation such as an operative report. 
## E = Excluded from physician fee schedule by regulation
These codes are for items or services that [[CMS]] chose to exclude from the fee schedule payment by regulation. No RVUs or payment amounts are shown, and no payment may be made under the fee schedule for these codes. Payment for them, when covered, continues under reasonable charge procedures. 
## I = Not valid for Medicare purposes
[[Medicare]] uses another code for reporting of, and payment for, these services. (Code NOT subject to a 90-day grace period.) 
## M = Measurement codes
Used for reporting purposes only. 
## N = Non-covered service
## P = Bundled and excluded codes
There are no RVUs and no payment amounts for these services. No separate payment is made for them under the fee schedule. If the item or service is covered as incident to a physician service and is given on the same day as a physician service, payment for it is bundled into the payment for the physician service to which it is incident (an example is an elastic bandage furnished by a physician incident to a physician service). If the item or service is covered as other than incident to a physician service, it is excluded from the fee schedule (for example, colostomy supplies) and is paid under the other payment provision of the Social Security Act. 
## Q = Therapy functional information code
Used for required reporting purposes only. This indicator is no longer effective beginning with the 2020 fee schedule as of January 1, 2020. 
## R = Restricted coverage
Special coverage instructions apply. 
## T = Paid as only service
These codes are paid only if there are no other services payable under the physician fee schedule billed on the same date by the same provider. If any other services payable under the physician fee schedule are billed on the same date by the same provider, these services are bundled into the physician services for which payment is made. 
## X = Statutory exclusion
These codes represent an item or service that isn’t in the statutory definition of physician services for fee schedule payment purposes. No RVUs or payment amounts are shown for these codes and no payment may be made under the physician fee schedule. (Examples are ambulance services and clinical diagnostic laboratory services.) 

# Global Surgery 
This field gives the postoperative time frames that apply to payment for each surgical procedure or another indicator that describes the applicability of the global concept to the service. 
## 000
Endoscopic or minor procedure with related preoperative and postoperative relative values on the day of the procedure only included in the fee schedule payment amount, evaluation and management services on the day of the procedure generally not payable. 
## 010
Minor procedure with preoperative relative values on the day of the procedure and postoperative relative values during a 10-day postoperative period included in the fee schedule amount; evaluation and management services on the day of the procedure and during this 10-day postoperative period generally not payable. 
## 090
[[Major Surgery]] with a 1-day preoperative period and 90-day postoperative period included in the fee schedule payment amount. 
## MMM
Maternity codes; usual global period doesn’t apply. 
## XXX
Global concept doesn’t apply. 
## YYY
MAC determines whether global concept applies and establishes postoperative period, if appropriate, at time of pricing.
## ZZZ
Code related to another service and is always included in the global period of the other service. (Note: Physician work is associated with intra-service time and in some instances the post service time.) 

# [[26 - Professional Component | PC]] / TC Indicator
## 0 = Physician service codes
This indicator identifies codes that describe physician services. Examples include visits, consultations, and surgical procedures. The concept of PC or TC doesn’t apply since physician services can’t be split into professional and technical components. [[Modifiers]] 26 and TC can’t be used with these codes. The total Relative Value Units (RVUs) include values for physician work, practice expense, and malpractice expense. There are some codes with no work RVUs. 
## 1 = Diagnostic tests or radiology services
This indicator identifies codes that describe diagnostic tests (for example, pulmonary function tests or therapeutic radiology procedures such as radiation therapy). These codes generally have both a professional and technical component. [[Modifiers]] 26 and TC can be used with these codes. The total RVUs for codes reported with a 26 [[Modifier]] include values for physician work, practice expense, and malpractice expense. The total RVUs for codes reported with a TC modifier include values for practice expense and malpractice expense only. The total RVUs for codes reported without a modifier equals the sum of RVUs for both the professional and technical component. 
## 2 = Professional component only codes
This indicator identifies stand alone codes that describe the physician work portion of selected diagnostic tests for which there is an associated code that describes the technical component of the diagnostic test only and another associated code that describes the global test. An example of a professional component only code is 93010, Electrocardiogram, interpretation, and report. Modifiers 26 and TC can’t be used with these codes. The total RVUs for professional component only codes include values for physician work, practice expense, and malpractice expense. 
## 3 = Technical component only codes
This indicator identifies stand alone codes that describe the technical component (such as staff and equipment costs) of selected diagnostic tests for which there is an associated code that describes the professional component of the diagnostic tests only. An example of a technical component code is 93005, Electrocardiogram, tracing only, without interpretation and report. It also identifies codes that are covered only as diagnostic tests and therefore don’t have a related professional code. Modifiers 26 and TC can’t be used with these codes. The total RVUs for technical component only codes include values for practice expense and malpractice expense only. 
## 4 = Global test only codes
This indicator identifies stand alone codes for which there are associated codes that describe: a) the professional component of the test only and b) the technical component of the test only. Modifiers 26 and TC can’t be used with these codes. The total RVUs for global procedure only codes include values for physician work, practice expense, and malpractice expense. The total RVUs for global procedure only codes equal the sum of the total RVUs for the professional and technical components only codes combined. 
## 5 = Incident to codes
This indicator identifies codes that describe services covered incident to a physician’s service when they are given by auxiliary personnel employed by the physician and working under his or her direct supervision. Payment may not be made by MACs for these services when they are given to hospital inpatients or patients in a hospital outpatient department. Modifiers 26 and TC can’t be used with these codes. 
## 6 = Laboratory physician interpretation codes
This indicator identifies clinical laboratory codes for which separate payment for interpretations by laboratory physicians may be made. Actual performance of the tests is paid for under the lab fee schedule. Modifier TC can’t be used with these codes. The total RVUs for laboratory physician interpretation codes include values for physician, work, practice expense, and malpractice expense. 
## 7 = Private practice therapist’s service
Payment may not be made if the service is given to either a beneficiary in a hospital outpatient department or to an inpatient of the hospital by a physical therapist, occupational therapist, or speech-language pathologist in private practice. 
## 8 = Physician interpretation codes
This indicator identifies the professional component of clinical laboratory codes for which separate payment may be made only if the physician interprets an abnormal smear for a hospital inpatient. This applies only to code 85060. No TC billing is recognized because payment for the underlying clinical laboratory test is made to the hospital, generally through the Prospective Payment System (PPS) rate. No payment is recognized for code 85060 furnished to hospital outpatients or non-hospital patients. The physician interpretation is paid through the clinical laboratory fee schedule payment for the clinical laboratory test. 
## 9 = Concept of PC / TC doesn’t apply

# Multiple Procedures ([[Modifier 51 - Multiple Procedures | Modifier 51]]) 
This indicator indicates which payment adjustment rule for multiple procedures applies to the service. 
## 0
### No payment adjustment rules for multiple procedures apply
If the procedure is reported on the same day as another procedure, payment is based on the lower of: (a) the actual charge or (b) the fee schedule amount for the procedure. 
## 1
### Standard payment adjustment rules in effect before 01/01/96 for multiple procedures apply
In the 1996 [[Medicare Physician Fee Schedule]] Database (MPFSDB), this indicator only applied to codes with procedure status of D. If a procedure is reported on the same day as another procedure with an indicator of 1, 2, or 3, Medicare ranks the procedures by the fee schedule amount and the appropriate reduction to this code is applied (100%, 50%, 25%, 25%, 25%, and by report). MACs base payment on the lower of: (a) the actual charge or (b) the fee schedule amount reduced by the appropriate percentage. 
## 2
### Standard payment adjustment rules for multiple procedures apply
If the procedure is reported on the same day as another procedure with an indicator of 1, 2, or 3, MACs rank the procedures by fee schedule amount and apply the appropriate reduction to this code (100%, 50%, 50%, 50%, 50%, and by report). MACs base payment on the lower of: (a) the actual charge or (b) the fee schedule amount reduced by the appropriate percentage.
## 3
### Special rules for multiple endoscopic procedures apply if procedure is billed with another endoscopy in the same family (that is, another endoscopy that has the same base procedure)
The base procedure for each code with this indicator is identified in field 31G of the Form CMS-1500 or its electronic equivalent claim. The multiple endoscopy rules apply to a family before ranking the family with other procedures performed on the same day (for example, if multiple endoscopies in the same family are reported on the same day as endoscopies in another family or on the same day as a non-endoscopic procedure). If an endoscopic procedure is reported with only its base procedure, the base procedure isn’t separately paid. Payment for the base procedure is included in the payment for the other endoscopy. 
## 4
### Diagnostic imaging services subject to MPPR methodology
TC of diagnostic imaging services subject to a 50% reduction of the second and subsequent imaging services furnished by the same physician (or by multiple physicians in the same group practice, for example, same group [[HIMT/RCM/Billing/Claim Forms/National Provider Identifier|National Provider Identifier]] [NPI]) to the same beneficiary on the same day, effective for services July 1, 2010, and after. PC of diagnostic imaging services are subject to a 25% payment reduction of the second and subsequent imaging services effective January 1, 2012.
## 5-6-7 = N/A
Multiple procedure indicator 5 isn’t included in this file, since the indicator represents the therapy multiple procedure payment reduction which never applies to professional service revenue codes. Multiple procedure indicators 6 and 7 aren’t included in this file, since in these cases the reduction only applies to technical component services. On CAH claims, technical components are paid on a cost basis and so aren’t subject to the reductions. 
## 9 = Concept doesn’t apply
Codes with RVUs equal to zero aren’t included in the payment indicator file. These codes may have multiple procedure indicators not shown. 
# Bilateral Surgery Indicator (Modifier 50) 
This field gives an indicator for services subject to a payment adjustment. 
## 0
### 150% payment adjustment for bilateral procedures doesn’t apply
If a procedure is reported with modifier 50 or with modifiers RT and LT, Medicare bases payment for the 2 sides on the lower of: 
1. the total actual charge for both sides or
2. 100% of the fee schedule amount for a single code. 
	- Example: The fee schedule amount for code XXXXX is $125. The physician reports code XXXXX-LT with an actual charge of $100 and XXXXX-RT with an actual charge of $100. Payment would be based on the fee schedule amount ($125) since it’s lower than the total actual charges for the left and right sides ($200). The bilateral adjustment is inappropriate for codes in this category because of (a) physiology or anatomy or (b) because the code descriptor specifically states that it’s a unilateral procedure and there is an existing code for the bilateral procedure.
## 1
### 150% payment adjustment for bilateral procedures applies
If a code is billed with the bilateral modifier or is reported twice on the same day by any other means (such as with RT and LT modifiers or with a 2 in the units field), payment is based for these codes when reported as bilateral procedures on the lower of: (a) the total actual charge for both sides or (b) 150% of the fee schedule amount for a single code. If code is reported as a bilateral procedure and is reported with other procedure codes on the same day, the bilateral adjustment is applied before applying any applicable multiple procedure rules. 
2 = 150% payment adjustment for bilateral procedure doesn’t apply
RVUs are already based on the procedure providers perform as a bilateral procedure. If a procedure is reported with modifier 50 or is reported twice on the same day by any other means (such as with RT and LT modifiers with a 2 in the units field), payment is based for both sides on the lower of (a) the total actual charges by the physician for both sides or (b) 100% of the fee schedule amount for a single code. Example: The fee schedule amount for code YYYYY is $125. The physician reports code YYYYY-LT with an actual charge of $100 and YYYYY-RT with an actual charge of $100. Payment would be based on the fee schedule amount ($125) since it is lower than the total actual charges for the left and right sides ($200). The RVUs are based on a bilateral procedure because: (a) the code descriptor specifically states that the procedure is bilateral; (b) the code descriptor states that the procedure may be performed either unilaterally or bilaterally; or (c) the procedure is usually performed as a bilateral procedure. 
## 3 = The usual payment adjustment for bilateral procedures doesn’t apply
If procedure is reported with modifier 50 or is reported for both sides on the same day by any other means (such as with RT and LT modifiers or with a 2 in the units field), Medicare bases payment for each side or organ or site of a paired organ on the lower of: (a) the actual charge for each side or (b) 100% of the fee schedule amount for each side. If procedure is reported as a bilateral procedure and with other procedure codes on the same day, the fee schedule amount for a bilateral procedure is determined before applying any applicable multiple procedure rules. Services in this category are generally radiology procedures or other diagnostic tests which aren’t subject to the special payment rules for other bilateral procedures.
