# Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC)
*Anesthesia service where the patient is under light sedation or no sedation while undergoing surgery with local anesthesia provided by the surgeon. The patient can respond to purposeful stimulation and can maintain his airway. The service is monitored by an anesthesia provider who is prepared to convert MAC to [[general anesthesia]] if necessary.*
