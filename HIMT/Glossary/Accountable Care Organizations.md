# Accountable Care Organizations (ACO)
*A healthcare organization characterized by a payment and care delivery model that seeks to tie provider reimbursements to quality metrics and reductions in the total cost of care for an assigned population of patients.*

Section 3022 of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|ACA]], which was signed into law by President Obama in March 2010, includes provisions for creation of a shared savings program. It states that, under such program:

	A. Groups of providers of services and suppliers meeting criteria specified by the Secretary may work together to manage and coordinate care for [[Medicare]] [[Fee-For-Service (FFS)|fee-for-service]] beneficiaries through an accountable care organization; and

	B. ACOs that meet quality performance standards established by the Secretary are eligible to receive payments for shared savings.

## Shared Savings Program
The Shared Savings Program is designed to improve [[Beneficiary]] outcomes and increase the value of care by promoting accountability for the care of [[Medicare]] [[Fee-For-Service (FFS)|fee-for-service]] beneficiaries, requiring coordinated care for all services provided under Medicare fee-for-service, and encouraging investment in infrastructure and redesigned care processes.

## ACO Structure
An ACO is made up of physicians and other providers, networks of individual practices of ACO professionals, partnerships, or joint venture arrangements between hospitals and ACO professionals, hospitals employing ACO professionals, and other providers and suppliers as determined by the Secretary of HHS. Any Medicare enrolled provider or supplier in good standing can participate in an ACO. An ACO must sign an agreement to participate for a period of at least three years
and agree to accept responsibility for at least 5,000 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries.

The basic idea for an ACO is that in the traditional fee-for-service arena providers are paid for each test and procedure performed. This may drive up costs as it rewards providers for doing more, even if it is not medically necessary. Medicare still pays ACO providers and suppliers as it does under the fee-for-service payment system but creates an incentive to be more efficient and keep costs down. There are specific quality benchmarks that are set that focus on disease prevention and management of patients with chronic diseases. CMS also sets benchmarks for each ACO if the ACO elects to share responsibility for losses. If the ACO does not save money or meet performance benchmarks, it may have to pay a penalty. If the ACO saves money and meets benchmarks, though, it is then eligible to share in savings under the program.

## ACO programs offered by Medicare
### Medicare Shared Savings Program
ACO for fee-for-service beneficiaries.
### Advance Payment ACO Model
ACO for providers already in or interested in the Medicare Shared Savings Program. Selected participants will receive upfront and monthly payments. It is designed for smaller ACOs with less access to capital to give them the ability to participate in the Shared Savings Program. There are three types of payments available: 
1. an upfront, fixed payment
2. an upfront, variable payment based on the number of its historically assigned beneficiaries, and
3. a monthly payment of varying amount depending on the size of the ACO based on its historically assigned beneficiaries.
### Pioneer ACO Model
ACO for healthcare organizations and providers already experienced in coordinating care for patients across care settings. This model allows for higher levels of shared savings and risk for ACOs. These ACOs will be in the shared savings payment model the first two years of the program and, in year three, if they have shown a specified level of savings, they will be eligible to move a large portion of their payments to a population-based model. ACOs are like [[Health Maintenance Organization|HMOs]] in that they have accountability and shared risk. They are unlike HMOs in that they do not function as insurance companies and they may be formed with only 5,000 beneficiaries. [[Health Maintenance Organization|HMOs]] usually have enrollees in the hundreds of thousands.

title: HOW DO ACOS DIFFER FROM HMOS?
Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) are insurance programs that provide healthcare to a defined population for a fixed price. 

ACOs and HMOs both rely on the creation of physician networks, promotion of member health and resource management to control costs. And, like HMOs, Pioneer ACOs will move to [[capitation]] payments in their third year of implementation. 

However, important differences do exist between ACOs and [[Health Maintenance Organization|HMOs]]. ACOs are not insurance companies and their providers will be financially rewarded for coordinating all aspects of patient care. Primary care providers will need to increase their reliance on nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and other members of the healthcare team to track appointment compliance, manage medication schedules, and oversee lifestyle changes. 

ACO patients can be seen by any physician of their choice. Patient [[participation]] in ACOs is strictly voluntary, there are no enrollment or lock in provisions. Patients who are unhappy with their care are free to seek treatment elsewhere. Consistent with traditional Medicare rules, there are no gate keeping or preauthorization provisions in the ACO model and patients arenâ€™t required to obtain a [[Referring Provider|referral]] before consulting with another provider
