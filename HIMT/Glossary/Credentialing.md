# Credentialing
*A process that is used to evaluate the qualifications and practice history of a physician which includes a review of a physician’s completed education, training, residency, and licenses.*

## Physician Credentialing/NPI Requirements
Physician credentialing is a process used to evaluate the qualifications and practice history of a physician, which includes a review of a physician’s completed education, training, residency, and licenses. It also includes any certifications issued by a board in the physician’s area of specialty. The process may also involve investigating any liability claims, association memberships, and status with HHS. 

Medical credentialing is used by various organizations and insurance companies to ensure that their healthcare providers meet all of the necessary requirements and are appropriately qualified. Physicians must have the necessary credentials and go through the process to participate with an insurance company. For [[Medicare]], credentialing is required to receive reimbursement. Credentialing allows a physician to become affiliated with insurance companies to be able to accept third-party reimbursement.

At a hospital, after a physician has met the credentialing requirements, the physician undergoes further [[Privileging]]. This assesses the physician’s expertise in a specific practice, like cardiology or surgery, based on documented competence in the specialty in which [[Privileging|privileges]] are requested. Each organization may require different information for the credentialing process. 

## Aetna credentialing example
For example, Aetna’s credentialing process includes:
1. Gathering information about a doctor’s background and qualifications through a formal application process:
	1. Checking the background information
	2. Checking the information against reliable sources, including the [[National Practitioner Data Bank]] and the [[American Board of Medical Specialties]]
2. Contacting:
	1. Any state where the doctor reports an active medical license and sees our members
	2. Schools and hospital programs, to be sure the doctor’s training is complete and accepted by the specialty board
	3. The [[National Technical Information Service]], [[Drug Enforcement Agency]] or [[Controlled Substance Registration]], as confirmation that the doctor is authorized to write prescriptions
	4. [[Medicare]]/[[Medicaid]], to be sure the doctor is not banned from caring for [[Medicare]]/[[Medicaid]] patients
3. Reviewing the doctor’s:
	1. Personal history, to determine if any disciplinary actions have been taken
	2. Malpractice insurance, to confirm active coverage
	3. Malpractice claims history
	4. Hospital [[Privileging|privileges]], to determine if privileges have been lost or limited
	5. Work history and employment background
	6. Information with Aetna’s Credentialing and Performance Committee, to determine whether or not the doctor should be included as participating in the network

Aetna also gathers specific information, including:
- Provider name and office location
- Provider gender
- Specialty(ies)
- Patient age focus
- Languages spoken
- Hospital affiliation
- Medical group affiliation
- Board certification
- Office status (indicating if office is accepting new patients)

Credentialing of a new provider can be very time consuming, but it’s an essential process for providers to provide services at facilities and participate with health plans. Billers must ensure that they have complete information on the providers and fill the applications out with detailed attention. The credentialing process can take months to complete on a new provider, but if not done properly, the provider will not be paid and will not have admitting [[Privileging|privileges]].
