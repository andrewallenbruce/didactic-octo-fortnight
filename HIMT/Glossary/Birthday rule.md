# Birthday rule
*Under the birthday rule, the health plan of the parent whose birthday comes first in the calendar year is designated as the primary plan.*

When a child is covered by two or more insurance plans (for example, insurance plans from both parents), the birthday rule is used to determine the primary and secondary insurance. According to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, under the birthday rule, the health plan of the member covering the dependent whose birthday comes first in the calendar year is designated as the primary plan. The year of birth is not a factor in this rule. The month and day are the only factors the health plan considers.

There are additional guidelines to the birthday rule:
1. If both parents have the same birthday the primary coverage reverts to the oldest policy
2. When regular coverage and [[COBRA]] coverage are in play, the regular coverage takes priority.
3. In divorce cases where the [[Custodial Parent]] has not remarried—the [[Custodial Parent]]’s plan is primary, and the non-[[Custodial Parent]]’s is secondary. If one parent has a group policy and the other has an individual plan, the group plan becomes the primary insurance.
4. In divorce cases where the [[Custodial Parent]] has remarried—The [[Custodial Parent]] coverage is primary, with the stepparent being secondary. The non-[[Custodial Parent]] is the payer of last resort.

This is not a law and may not be followed by all payers. State laws regarding coverage policies involving minors and custodial parents may supersede the payer’s rules including the birthday rule.
