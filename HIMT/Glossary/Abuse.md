# Abuse
*An action that results in unnecessary costs to a federal healthcare program, either directly or indirectly*

## [[CMS]] examples of abuse:
- Misusing codes on a claim
- Charging excessively for services or supplies
- Billing for services that were not medically necessary
- Failure to maintain adequate medical or financial records
- Improper billing practices
- Billing [[Medicare]] patients a higher [[fee schedule]] than non-Medicare patients

[[Fraud]] and abuse carry stiff penalties under 42 USC ยง 1320a-7a of the United States Code. Civil monetary penalties (CMPs) may be imposed to varying amounts, depending on the type of violation. These penalties range from $10,000 to $50,000 (before inflation adjustment) per violation and can include up to three times the amount claimed for each item or service, or up to three times the amount of remuneration offered, paid, solicited, or received, whether a portion of such remuneration was offered, paid, solicited, or received for a lawful purpose. On top of all that, exclusion from [[Participation]] in the federal healthcare programs and state healthcare programs may be imposed, along with criminal penalties of fines, imprisonment, or both. 

The Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of Health & Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG), and the [[CMS|Centers for Medicare & Medicaid]] Services (CMS) are the government agencies that enforce the federal [[fraud]] and abuse laws.
