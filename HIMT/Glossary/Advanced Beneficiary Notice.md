# Advanced [[Beneficiary]] Notice (ABN)
*A standardized form that explains to the patient why [[Medicare]] may deny the particular service or procedure. An ABN protects the providerâ€™s financial interest by creating a paper trail that [[CMS]] requires before a provider can bill the patient for payment if Medicare denies coverage for the stated service or procedure.*
