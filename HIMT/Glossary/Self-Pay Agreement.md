While I have NEVER seen an instance where an overzealous government attorney or prosecutor has chosen to attack a physician on the Stark Self-Referral or “Incentive-to-refer” implications in the laws, I have been repeatedly told that these exist. OK – so does this mean that you can’t give a self-pay patient a break? Not in my opinion, but I am not an attorney and I do not play one on television.

OK – here is something that should protect you in case you decide to give a cash patient a break on their bill. Have the patient sign this form:

> I, ___________________________________________, (“Patient/Guarantor”) wish to negotiate a payment arrangement for services rendered on the date of service referenced above. Furthermore, I declare that I do not have health insurance of any kind and this payment negotiation is not based on any possible referrals that could be made by me.

Once you have the patient sign the above form, you should probably be covered. Once again, we recommend you give patients a break when they need it – but just because someone has no insurance, that doesn’t mean they can’t afford it – as they may choose to spend the money on other elective things instead of insurance.

How many patients have you seen that are driving nicer cars than your office manager, carrying purses that cost more than the High School Class Ring that you bought your high school senior and carrying an expensive IPOD or IPhone and they ask you for a break because they have no insurance.

They may be choosing to pay for 220 cable channels, a Wii, name brand jeans, cigarettes and choosing NOT to pay for health insurance.
