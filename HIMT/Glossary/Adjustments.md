There are 3 basic kinds of adjustments to patient balances in medical accounting:

1.  Contractual Adjustments
    
2.  Bad Debt Adjustments
    
3.  Courtesy or Professional Adjustments
    

# Contractual Adjustments

These are the adjustments or write-offs that reflect the difference between the amount allowed to be collected on a contract and the amount charged. As an example, let’s assume you’re charging $100 for 99213 and Medicare’s allowed is $94.94 (the average allowed in 2021 for 99213 in all Medicare localities).

That means that you’ll have a $5.06 contractual adjustment. That’s normal and does not reflect negatively on the billing agency, manager or staff. If Blue Cross has an approved amount of $80.00, and you charged $100, then you have a $20 contractual adjustment (if you are contracted with the carrier)

# Bad Debt Adjustment

This is the amount written off because you can’t collect it, for whatever reason. This is the amount that reflects negatively on the billing agency, staff and managers. When you turn an account to a collection agency, the amount should be adjusted off to bad debt and should not be carried on the normal accounts receivable.

# Courtesy / Professional Adjustments

These are the adjustments that we make by choice because we want to give another physician a break, a discount to the employee, a discount to the clergy, military, etc.

These should be monitored – but again – they do not reflect negatively on the billing agency, staff or managers.

The accounts receivable should be kept clean for several reasons, including for bankers as collateral for a loan if you ever need it. Bankers will not loan money on a sloppy accounts receivable, but many will loan up to 70% on a clean and truthful A/R.

Another reason for a clean A/R is that the A/R is an asset of the business. If the business owner (such as physician) passes away – you do not want the spouse paying estate taxes on uncollectible money, so keep the A/R clean.
