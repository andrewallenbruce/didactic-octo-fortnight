# Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)
*Federal law in which the primary goal is to make it easier for people to keep health insurance, protect the confidentiality and security of healthcare information, and help the healthcare industry control administrative costs*

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) was enacted on August 21, 1996. HIPAA was originally passed to provide rights and protections for participants and beneficiaries of [[group health plans]]. Under this law, exclusions for pre-existing conditions were limited, and discrimination against employees and dependents based on their health status were prohibited. HIPAA also established the Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Control Program (HCFAC), a far-reaching program to combat [[fraud]] and [[abuse]] in healthcare including both public and private health plans. HCFAC is designed to coordinate federal, state, and local law enforcement activities with respect to healthcare fraud and abuse. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Department of Justice (DOJ) are required to provide an annual report detailing the efforts and recoveries made by the HCFAC program.

HIPAA Administrative Simplification provisions required that sections of the law be publicized to explain the standards for the electronic exchange, privacy, and security of health information. Congress did not enact privacy legislation within the specified time governed by HIPAA. The HHS then developed a proposed rule, which was published and released in final form on August 14, 2002.

## Privacy Rule
The Privacy Rule standards address how an individual’s [[protected health information]] (PHI) may be used. [[Protected Health Information]] is “individually identifiable health information” that includes many common identifiers, such as demographic data, name, address, birth date, and social security number. It also includes information that relates to an individual’s past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition; the provision of healthcare to the individual; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of healthcare to the individual, which reasonably may be used to identify an individual. 

To fully understand [[protected health information]], let’s look at the definitions of health information and individually identifiable health information. For information to be regulated by the Privacy Rule, the information would need to fall within both definitions.

```ad-Law
title: HEALTH INFORMATION
**Section 1171 of Part C of Subtitle F of Public Law 104-191**

(4) HEALTH INFORMATION. The term health information means any information, whether oral or recorded in any form or medium, that:

- (A) is created or received by a healthcare provider, health plan, public health authority, employer, life insurer, school or university, or healthcare clearinghouse; and

- (B) relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual, the provision of healthcare to an individual, or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of healthcare to an individual
```

```ad-Law
title: INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH INFORMATION
**Section 1171 of Part C of Subtitle F of Public Law 104-191**

(6) INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH INFORMATION–The term ‘individually identifiable health information’ means any information, including demographic information collected from an individual, that:

- (A) is created or received by a healthcare provider, health plan, employer, or healthcare clearinghouse; and

- (B) relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual, the provision of healthcare to an individual, or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of healthcare to an individual, and

	- (i) identifies the individual; or

	- (ii) with respect to which there is a reasonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify the individual
```
### Covered Entities
The purpose of the Privacy Rule is to protect individual privacy while promoting high quality healthcare and public health and well-being. All covered entities are required to follow the Privacy Rule. Covered entities are defined as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and any healthcare provider who transmits health information in an electronic format.
#### Health Plans
**Health Plan** covered entities are organizations that pay providers on behalf of an individual receiving medical care. These plans include health, dental, vision, and prescription drug insurers (for example, [[Health Maintenance Organization|Health Maintenance Organizations]] (HMOs), [[Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], and employer, government, and church-sponsored [[group health plans]]). There are exceptions, such as an employer who solely establishes and maintains the plan with fewer than 50 participants is exempt. Two types of government-funded programs are exempt; food stamps and community health centers. Insurers providing only workers’ compensation, automobile insurance, and property and casualty insurance are not considered to be health plans.
#### Healthcare Providers
**Healthcare providers** who electronically transmit health information through certain transactions are covered entities. Some examples of transactions that may be submitted electronically are claim forms, inquiries about eligibility of benefits, and requests for authorization of referrals. Simply using electronic technology, such as sending emails, does not mean a healthcare provider is a [[covered entity]]; the transmission must be in connection with a standard transaction. The rule applies to all healthcare providers, regardless of whether they transmit the transactions directly, or use a billing service or other third party to transmit on their behalf.
#### Healthcare Clearinghouses
**Healthcare clearinghouses** include billing services, repricing companies, and community health management information systems that process nonstandard information, received from another entity, into a standard (or vice versa).
#### Business Associates
Business associates perform certain functions or activities, which involve the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, on behalf of another person or organization. These services include claims processing or administration, data analysis, utilization review, billing, benefit management, and re-pricing. Business associate services to a [[covered entity]] are limited to legal, actuarial, accounting, consulting, data aggregation, management, administrative, accreditation, or financial services. To be considered a business associate, the persons or organizations would involve the use or disclosure of [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] between the two parties.
### HITECH Act
The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, also specifies that an organization that provides data transmission of [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] to a [[covered entity]] and that requires access to [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] routinely, such as a Health Information Exchange Organization (HIEO), will be treated as a business associate. A contract is required between business associates to impose specified written safeguards on the individually identifiable health information used or disclosed by the business associate. If a [[covered entity]] identifies a material breach or violation of the contract or agreement, reasonable steps must be taken to cure the breach
or end the violation. If that is not possible, the contract must be terminated, and the problem reported to the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR).

The Privacy Rule includes exceptions to the business associate standard, which do not require a [[covered entity]] to have a written agreement in place prior to disclosing [[Protected Health Information|PHI]]. Examples include:
- Disclosures by a [[covered entity]] to a healthcare provider for treatment of the individual, such as:
	- A healthcare provider scheduling a surgery at a hospital for the patient.
	- A healthcare provider sending specimens to a hospital lab or reference lab for analysis
	- A hospital transferring a patient to a nursing home for continued care
- Disclosures to a health plan sponsor, such as an employer, by a [[Group Health Plans|group health plan]] that provides the health insurance benefits or coverage for the [[Group Health Plans|group health plan]].
- The collection and sharing of [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] by a health plan that is a public benefits program, such as [[Medicare]].

The Privacy Rule allows for de-identification of health information. To de-identify health information, any information that could help identify the individual is removed. This includes the following information as it relates to the individual patient, relatives, employers, or household members:
- Names
- Demographic information (geographic subdivisions smaller than a state, including street address, city, county, precinct, ZIP code, and their equivalent geocodes)
- Dates directly related to the individual (date of birth, admission and discharge dates, death date, etc.)
- Telephone numbers, fax numbers, and email addresses
- Social security numbers
- Medical record numbers
- Health plan [[beneficiary]] numbers (health plan ID, health plan subscriber number)
- Account numbers
- Certificate/license numbers
- Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers
- Device identifiers and serial numbers (for example, implants)
- Web Universal Resource Locators (URLs) and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
- Biometric identifiers, including finger and voiceprints
- Full-face photographs and any comparable images
- Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code

De-identification guidance can be found on the HHS website: [Methods for De-identification of PHI | HHS.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/De-identification/guidance.html#rationale). There are no restrictions on the use of de-identified health information. When the [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] is removed, a reasonable basis does not exist to identify an individual.

```ad-billing
title: Billing
De-identified health information may also be referred to as redacted. Redacted means to obscure or remove information from a document prior to release.
```

A [[covered entity]] may not use or disclose [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] unless the Privacy Rule permits it, or as the individual authorizes in writing. The rule requires that a [[covered entity]] must disclose [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] to an individual when he or she requests his or her own information or to HHS when it is investigating for compliance, review, or enforcement action. Permitted uses and disclosures of [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] allow a [[covered entity]] to use and disclose certain information without an individual’s authorization in the following situations:
1. Release of records to the individual who is the subject of the information. A patient has the right to inspect, review, and receive a copy of their medical records and billing records. A provider may charge a reasonable cost for copying and mailing the records.
2. By a [[covered entity]] for treatment, payment, and healthcare operation activities.
	1. Treatment is the provision, coordination, or management of healthcare services among healthcare providers. This includes consultation between healthcare providers regarding a patient, or the referral of a patient from one healthcare provider to another. 
	2. Payment includes a variety of activities for a provider to be reimbursed for their services and for a health plan to obtain premiums and provide benefits. Examples of payment activities include determining eligibility and benefits, billing and collection activities, reviewing healthcare services for [[medical necessity]], coverage, justification of charges, and [[adjudication]] of [[Claim Form|claims]]. 
	3. Operation includes administrative, financial, legal, and quality improvement activities necessary to run a business and support the core functions of treatment and payment. Examples of operations include quality assessment and improvement activities, evaluating provider and health plan performance, conducting medical review, legal, and [[Audit|auditing]] services including [[fraud]] and [[abuse]] detection and compliance programs.
3. The individual may grant informal permission by being asked outright, giving them the opportunity to agree or object in circumstances where the individual is not capable of providing his or her signature. Covered entities are expected to use their judgment in situations where the patient is incapacitated, or the [[covered entity]] is not available to provide the care that is in the best interest of the patient. For example, this provision allows for a pharmacist to dispense filled prescriptions to a person acting on behalf of the patient, or for notifying family members of the individual’s location, general condition, or death.
4. Incidental use and disclosure is permitted if the [[covered entity]] has reasonable safeguards in place to ensure that the information being shared is limited to the “minimum necessary,” as required by the Privacy Rule. According to the OCR, an incidental use or disclosure is “a secondary use or disclosure that cannot reasonably be prevented, is limited in nature, and occurs because of another use or disclosure that is permitted by the rule.”

```ad-Example
title: CASE EXAMPLE: ACCESS TO MEDICAL RECORDS
**Private Practice Revises Process to Provide Access to Records**

*Covered Entity*: Private Practices

*Issue*: Access

A private practice failed to honor an individual’s request for a complete copy of her minor son’s medical record. OCR’s investigation determined that the private practice had relied on state regulations that permit a [[covered entity]] to provide a summary of the record. OCR provided technical assistance to the [[covered entity]], explaining that the Privacy Rule permits a [[covered entity]] to provide a summary of patient records rather than the full record only if the requesting individual agrees in advance to such a summary or explanation. Among other corrective actions to resolve the specific issues in the case, OCR required the [[covered entity]] to revise its policy. In addition, the covered entity forwarded the complainant a complete copy of the medical record.

### Minimum Necessary
The Minimum Necessary Standard is a key protection of HIPAA Privacy Rule. The rule requires covered entities to take reasonable steps to limit the use or disclosure of, and requests for, [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. A [[covered entity]] is required to develop and implement policies and procedures to reasonably limit uses and disclosures to the minimum necessary.

When the minimum necessary standard applies to a use or disclosure, a [[covered entity]] may not use, disclose, or request the entire medical record for a purpose, unless it can specifically justify the whole record as the amount reasonably needed for that purpose.

For example, when documentation is requested by a payer for processing of a claim, only documentation pertinent to that service should be sent to the payer. Sending the entire medical record would be a violation of minimum necessary.

```ad-billing
title: Billing
Medical billers often receive requests for medical records for processing claims. A medical biller should respond to the request for records by providing only the dates of service requested, or the minimum necessary.
```

```ad-Example
title: CASE EXAMPLE: MINIMUM NECESSARY
**Hospital Implements New Minimum Necessary Polices for Telephone Messages**

*Covered Entity:* General Hospital

*Issue:* Minimum Necessary; Confidential Communications

A hospital employee did not observe minimum necessary requirements when she left a telephone message with the daughter of a patient that detailed both her medical condition and treatment plan. An OCR investigation also indicated that the confidential communications requirements were not followed, as the employee left the message at the patient’s home telephone number, despite the patient’s instructions to contact her through her work number. To resolve the issues in this case, the hospital developed and implemented several new procedures. One addressed the issue of minimum necessary information in telephone message content. Employees were trained to provide only the minimum necessary information in messages and were given specific direction as to what information could be left in a message. Employees also were trained to review registration information for patient contact directives regarding leaving messages. The new procedures were incorporated into the standard staff privacy training, both as part of a refresher series and mandatory yearly compliance training.

### The 12 National Priority Purposes
To strike a balance between the individual interest and public interest for specific [[Protected Health Information|PHI]], the Privacy Rule permits use and disclosure of this information without an individual’s authorization or permission through public interest and benefit activities. There are 12 national priority purposes:
1. Required by law: [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] may be disclosed by a [[covered entity]] when required by law. This includes by statute, regulation, or court orders.
2. Public health activities: [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] may be released to public health authorities who are legally authorized to receive reports to prevent and control disease, injury, or disability. This may also include releasing information for the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) regulated products and for individuals who may have contracted or been exposed to a communicable disease when notification is authorized by law.
3. Victims of abuse, neglect or domestic violence:  A provider may disclose PHI to report known or suspected child abuse or neglect to a public health authority such as the social services department of a local government.
4. Health oversight activities: [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] may be disclosed to health oversight agencies for legally authorized health oversight activities. Audits and investigations for oversight of the healthcare system and government benefit programs such as [[Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] are included in these oversight activities.
5. Judicial and administrative proceedings:  Court orders and administrative tribunals allow the release of [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] in a judicial or administrative proceeding. When a provider receives a subpoena, they may release the [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] if notice is given to the individual or a protective order is provided.
6. Law enforcement purposes: [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] may be released for law enforcement purposes.
	1. as required by law (court order, court ordered warrants, etc.)
	2. to identify or locate a suspect, fugitive, material witness, or missing person
	3. for information about a victim or suspected victim of a crime
	4. about a death when there is suspicion that criminal activity caused death
	5. as evidence of a crime that occurred on the [[covered entity]]’s premises
	6. in a medical emergency, not occurring on the premises, to inform law enforcement of details about the crime such as the nature of the crime, location, etc.
7. Decedents:  [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] may be released to coroners, medical examiners, and funeral directors.
8. Cadaveric organ, eye, or tissue donation: Facilitation of donation and transplantation of cadaveric organs, eye, or tissue can be released by a [[covered entity]].
9. Research: Information used in research can be de-identified. If the information is de-identified, it is not covered by the Privacy Rule. Information that is not de-identified may be used without individual authorization for research in limited circumstances.
10. Serious threat to health or safety: [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] may be released to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to a person or the public.
11. Essential government functions:  Some activities included in essential government functions include protecting the health and safety of inmates or employees in a correctional institution, assuring proper execution of a military mission, etc.
12. Workers’ compensation: The Privacy Rule does not apply to workers’ compensation insurers, workers’ compensation administrative agencies, or employers. Covered entities may disclose [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] when required by workers’ compensation laws or to obtain payment. The Minimum Necessary provision must be taken into consideration when determining what to disclose.

```ad-billing
title: Billing
A [[covered entity]] may disclose [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] required by a court order or administrative tribunal. A subpoena issued by a court clerk or an attorney in a case (someone other than a judge) is not synonymous with a court order. When a subpoena is issued, it should be accompanied by a court order to release the records. Only the records specified in the order may be disclosed. When the subpoena is not accompanied by a court order, the [[covered entity]] must make a reasonable effort to:

1. Notify the person who is the subject of the [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] about the request, giving them a chance to object to the disclosure; or

2. Seek a qualified protective order for the information from the court.

Source: [Court Orders and Subpoenas | HHS.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/consumers/courtorders.html)
```

A limited data set is [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] from which certain specified direct identifiers have been removed. Limited data sets may be used for research, healthcare operations, and public health purposes, as long as there is an agreement with promised safeguards in place for the PHI.

A privacy practice notice must be provided by each [[covered entity]]. The notice must clearly explain the [[covered entity]]’s obligation to protect privacy, provide a notice of privacy practices, and abide by the terms of the current notice. The [[covered entity]] should also inform the patient of his or her individual rights, and the steps to follow (including a point of contact for further information) if an individual feels his or her privacy rights have been violated.

Covered entities are required to supply a notice to anyone upon request, whether direct or indirect treatment was provided. In addition, covered entities also need to make its privacy notice available electronically on any website it maintains for customer service or benefits information.

A healthcare provider must make a good faith effort to obtain written acknowledgement from patients that the patients have received the privacy practices notice. Most covered entities ask for signatures from individuals, indicating that the individual was provided a copy of the notice. Receipt of acknowledgement is relieved in emergent situations.

In most cases, individuals have the right to review and obtain copies of their [[Protected Health Information|PHI]]. Areas excluded from the rights of access are: psychotherapy notes, information related to legal proceedings, and certain lab results or information held by research laboratories. Covered entities may charge a reasonable fee for
providing such information.

There is some flexibility and scalability built into the rule to allow analysis of each entity’s needs, and to implement the required rules appropriately. The administrative requirements that must be followed are:
- All covered entities must have written privacy policies that comply with the Privacy Rule.
- A privacy official must be designated to be responsible for developing and implementing privacy policies and procedures, and be the contact person for individuals with questions or concerns regarding the privacy practices.
- All members of a [[covered entity]]’s workforce (employees, volunteers, and trainees) must be trained on the [[covered entity]]’s privacy policies. Appropriate sanctions must be applied to a workforce member who violates any area of the privacy rules.
- Covered entities are required to mitigate any harmful effect that may have been caused by inappropriate use or disclosure of [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] that was caused by its workforce or business associates.
- Procedures must be in place to allow an individual to complain about a [[covered entity]]’s compliance with their privacy policies.
- A [[covered entity]] may not retaliate against a person for exercising his or her rights provided by the Privacy Rule or require an individual to waive any right to obtain healthcare services.
- Privacy policies must be maintained by covered entities for six years, after the later of the date of their creation, or last effective date.
- Fully insured [[group health plans]] have only two obligations: 
	- (1) refrain from retaliatory acts and waiver of individual rights, and 
	- (2) to provide documentation for the disclosure of [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] through documentation.

## Security Rule
The HIPAA Security Rule was established by the HIPAA Administrative Simplification Regulations to establish national standards to protect and secure patient data that is stored or transmitted electronically. It requires that appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards are in place to ensure confidentiality and security of patient health information. This regulation is to be adopted by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and covered healthcare providers. The Security Rule also requires policies and procedures be implemented to comply with the Security Rule. The policies and procedures are required to be maintained for six years from the date of creation or the date when last in effect, whichever is later.

A breach notification rule requires HIPAA covered entities to provide notification in the event of an unsecured breach of patient health information. A breach occurs when an impermissible release of, or disclosure of information is discovered. A breach can occur by many methods, such as discs, USB, or thumb drives being misplaced or lost, paper or hard copies not being properly disposed of, backup files not being secure, and/or information being sent to unprotected portable devices.

```ad-Example
title: CASE EXAMPLE: BREACH
A hospital system took custody of medical records belonging to a retiring physician with the intent of assisting in the transition of care for the 5,000-8,000 patients and considered the possibility of purchasing the physician’s practice. Hospital staff returned the records to the physician’s home, in his absence, and left 70 boxes of records on the driveway unattended. Because the hospital was a [[covered entity]] with custody of the records, they were responsible to safeguard the [[protected health information]] in its custody. The settlement of $800,000 also stated that a corrective action plan be put in place to update policies and procedures, and to educate staff.
```

```ad-billing
title: Billing
The biller should be aware of the Security Rule and of the office policy in case of a breach of [[Protected Health Information|PHI]]. Physician offices are responsible for controlling the way in which patient’s [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] is used, stored, and disclosed.
```

### Transaction and Code Sets
Transactions occur through electronic exchanges, which allow information to be transferred between two parties for specific purposes. A healthcare provider will send a claim to a health plan to request payment for the medical services he or she provides. Under HIPAA, provisions were included for Administrative Simplification that mandated HHS to adopt national standards for electronic healthcare transactions and code sets. The eight standard transactions for [[Electronic Data Interchange]] (EDI) adopted under HIPAA are:

1. Claims and encounter information;
2. Healthcare payment and remittance advice;
3. Healthcare [[Claim Form|claims]] status;
4. Eligibility for a health plan;
5. Enrollment and disenrollment in a health plan;
6. Referrals and authorizations;
7. [[Coordination of benefits]]; and
8. Health plan premium payments.

If a [[covered entity]] under HIPAA conducts any of the above transactions electronically, they must use the adopted standard-ASC X12 Version 5010 or NCPDP (used for certain pharmacy transactions) for each transaction.

An additional rule was also adopted to standardize the code sets for diagnoses and procedures to be used in all transactions. The code sets adopted are:
- Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System ([[HCPCS Level II|HCPCS]]): code set established by [[CMS]] to represent services not covered by [[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]]®
- Current Procedure Terminology ([[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]]®): code set maintained by the American Medical Association to describe medical procedures and physician services
- International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification, (ICD-10-CM) contains the diagnosis codes and is maintained by the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control. ICD-10-PCS contains procedures and is maintained by [[CMS]] and is used to report procedures for inpatient hospital services.
- National Drug Codes (NDC): code set that identifies vendor, product, and package size of all drugs and biologicals recognized by the FDA, maintained by HHS.
- Current Dental Terminology (CDT®): code set for dental services maintained by the American Dental Association (ADA).
- Place of Service Codes: two-digit codes placed on all healthcare professional claims that denote the setting in which the service was provided. The codes are maintained by CMS.

In addition to the standardization of the codes used to request payment for medical services, a unique identifier for employers and providers must be used on all transactions.
