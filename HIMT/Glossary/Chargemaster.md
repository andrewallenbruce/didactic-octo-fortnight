# Chargemaster
*A hospital-specific electronic list that includes all hospital procedures, services, supplies, and drugs that are billed to payers. Synonymous with charge description master (CDM).*

A hospital charge description master (CDM), also called a chargemaster, is a master price list of all services, supplies, devices, and medications charged for inpatient or outpatient services by a healthcare facility. It is like a charge ticket or encounter form in the medical office, but much more extensive.

The design and functionality of the chargemaster allows for services and procedures to be captured at the time the service is delivered or the procedure is performed. Because of this functionality, the CDM must be continually monitored and updated as necessary to ensure accuracy and compliance. 

Virtually every area within the facility that provides services or performs procedures has interest in the chargemaster data. When a service or procedure is rendered during a patient’s hospital stay, healthcare workers enter the data into the facility’s software system, which gathers the data and holds it in the patient’s account until the patient is discharged. Upon discharge the patient’s account is reviewed and verified by the billing department personnel. Once the review is complete, the data is transmitted electronically in [[UB-04]] claim format either directly to the payer or to a clearinghouse. If error free, reimbursement is made to the facility.

Reimbursement for [[Medicare]] and other payers is based on either the medical severity—diagnosis related group (MS-DRG) payment amount for the inpatient stay or the ambulatory payment classification (APC) payment amount for outpatient encounters or services. In the case of Medicare reimbursement for outpatient services, [[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]]® or [[HCPCS Level II|HCPCS]] Level II codes assigned to charges will be translated into APC groups. Each APC will generate a predetermined payment amount, which is multiplied by the number of units of the charge.

Although many separate APCs may be billed and reimbursed for covered outpatient services on one claim or date of service, most supplies and many of the drugs associated with the services are bundled and will not receive a separate APC payment. As a result, capture and coding of all service charges, medical visits, or diagnostic and surgical procedures are critical to facility reimbursement per encounter, because the APC payment theoretically includes payment for drugs and supplies.

Like [[Medicare]], third-party payers each have their own respective reimbursement guidelines. They may or may not reimburse a charge without a [[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]]® or [[HCPCS Level II]] code, but they will all require at least a revenue code for reimbursement of charge items. A revenue code indicates the location or type of service provided for an inpatient and is reported with a four-digit code.
Although most state [[Medicaid]] programs follow Medicare rules, many have created coding requirements specific to their states.

*The example below illustrates the typical hospital’s CDM layout.*

The symbol *** indicates that these services do not have a CPT®/HCPCS Level II code built into the CDM. Some services, such as surgeries, are dynamically coded (hand entered) on a case-by-case basis and reviewed quarterly, semiannually, or annually, depending on the facility.

Hospitals may have a CDM task force or a single individual who is responsible for maintaining accurate data within the CDM to ensure compliant and optimal billing, reimbursement, and data collection. The CDM task force is responsible for:

1. Review at least annually.
	
2. Maintain updates throughout the year as new procedures or supplies are incorporated into the hospital’s service line.
	
3. Review and maintain payer information (bulletins, transmittals) and make CDM adjustments based on that information.

The coder and biller are not always involved in every aspect of the code assignment in the hospital. However, it is important to have an overall understanding of coding and billing and its impact on reimbursement for the facility.

Many other departments are involved in the CDM process. Depending on the size of the facility, information management services, the compliance department, and patient financial services (reimbursement department) may also be involved in updating the CDM.

The CDM is essential for obtaining appropriate reimbursement. Approximately 75 percent of outpatient services are driven by the CDM. There are typically between 3,000 and 30,000 (or more) line items, and literally hundreds of CPT®
code changes each year.

## CDM Review Tasks
1. Ensure all codes are valid (CPT® and HCPCS Level II).
2. Deactivate outdated or unused codes.
3. Add new codes.
4. Evaluate all unlisted CPT® codes.
5. Verify code description is accurate and corresponds to CPT®/HCPCS Level II descriptor.
6. Once review is complete, compare to Medicare’s Outpatient Code Editor (OCE) to determine if any services should not be billed.
7. Review CPT®/HCPCS Level II for correct revenue code assignment.
8. Evaluate third digit to ensure accuracy for revenue code assignment.
9. Review for more appropriate revenue code.
10. Ensure that all outpatient services have a corresponding CPT®/HCPCS Level II code.
11. Charges submitted without a CPT®/HCPCS Level II code will not be paid under an APC.
12. Monitor for duplication of services.
13. Review departments’ charge tickets to ensure codes correlate to CDM.
14. Review sample UB-04 claim forms prospectively and remittance advice notices retrospectively to verify information.
