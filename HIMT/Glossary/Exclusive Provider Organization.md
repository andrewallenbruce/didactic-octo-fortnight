# Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO)
*An organization that has entered into contracts with medical care providers or groups of medical care providers to provide healthcare services to members.*

An EPO differs from an [[Health Maintenance Organization|HMO]] in that if the member does not receive services from an in-network provider or facility, the member pays for all costs incurred, unless there is an emergency. Providers usually sign an exclusive contract with the EPO that restricts them from contracting with other [[Managed Care Plans]]. As with an HMO, EPO members choose a [[Primary Care Provider|PCP]] upon enrollment. Members then pay a percentage of every medical bill up to a yearly maximum out-of-pocket. Some EPOs allow members to go to a specialist without a referral. EPOs earn more money by charging an access fee to the insurer for use of the network. EPOs negotiate with the medical care providers of the organization in order to set fee schedules, help resolve differences between the insurer and medical care providers, and contract with other EPOs to strengthen their networks in certain areas.
