# Conditions of Participation (CoP)
*Conditions that healthcare organizations must meet in order to participate with the plan or program*

CMS and other health plans have conditions that healthcare organizations must meet to participate with the plan or program. CoPs are designed to protect patient health and safety, and to ensure quality of care. These apply to entities such as: ambulatory surgical centers, hospitals, hospices, clinics, psychiatric hospitals, long term care facilities, and transplant centers.

## Records Retention
Medical records need to be retained for many reasons:
- Provide continuity of care
- Support services with health plan claim inquiries
- Assist in audits
- Meet legal requirements
- Provide defense against complaints and negligence claims
- Required as a condition of participation in a health plan

Many things need to be taken into consideration when deciding on a time frame for medical record retention. A single standardized record retention schedule does not exist.

```ad-Law
title: CMS CoPS CONTAIN INFORMATION ON RECORDS RETENTION
§482.24 Condition of participation: Medical record services.

The hospital must have a medical record service that has administrative responsibility for medical records. A medical record must be maintained for every individual evaluated or treated in the hospital.

(a) Standard: Organization and staffing– The organization of the medical record service must be appropriate to the scope and complexity of the services performed. The hospital must employ adequate personnel to ensure prompt completion, filing, and retrieval of records.

(b) Standard: Form and retention of record– The hospital must maintain a medical record for each inpatient and outpatient. Medical records must be accurately written, promptly completed, properly filed and retained, and accessible. The hospital must use a system of author identification and record maintenance that ensures the integrity of the authentication and protects the security of all record entries.

- (1) Medical records must be retained in their original or legally reproduced form for a period of at least 5 years.

CMS requirements for records are as follows:
- Medical records must be retained in their original or legally reproduced form for a period of at least five years.
- For providers submitting cost reports to be retained in their original or legally reproduced form for a period of at least five years after the closure of the cost report.
- For Managed care programs, providers should retain records for 10 years. 

Medical records may be retained in any media format: paper, electronic, or digital. The only requirement is that it be either in its original form or in a legally reproduced form.

The [[HIPAA]] Privacy Rule does not include medical record retention requirements. It does, however, require that covered entities apply appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the privacy of medical records and other [[Protected Health Information|PHI]] for whatever period such information is maintained by a [[covered entity]], including through disposal. The administrative simplification rules under [[HIPAA]] require a covered entity to retain required documentation for six years form the date of its creation or the date when it was last in effect, whichever is later. HIPAA requirements take precedence over state laws if they require shorter periods of retention. State laws on records retention vary from type of provider (medical doctor versus hospital) and age of patient (adult versus minor).

The federal [[False Claims Act]] (31 USC § 3729) allows for claims to be brought up to seven years after the incident but has been extended to 10 years in some cases. This should be kept in mind.
