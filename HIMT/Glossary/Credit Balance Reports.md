# Credit Balance Reports
CMS requires a Credit Balance Report (CMS-838) be submitted within 30 days after the end of each quarter for all providers participating in the Medicare program.

A credit balance exists when a facility receives an overpayment for a Medicare service, for example:

-   A facility is paid twice for the same service either by Medicare or by Medicare and another insurer
-   A facility is paid for services planned but not performed or for non-covered services
-   A facility is overpaid because of errors made in calculating beneficiary deductible and/or coinsurance amounts
-   A facility bills and is paid for outpatient services included in a beneficiary's inpatient claim

Submit Credit Balance Reports via [Credit Balance 838 Forms fax number](https://med.noridianmedicare.com/web/jfa/contact/fax-numbers) by the due dates below.
