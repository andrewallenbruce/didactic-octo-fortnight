# Qui Tam
*A lawsuit brought by a private citizen against a person or company who is believed to have violated the law in the performance of a contract with the government or in violation of a government regulation, when there is a statute which provides for a penalty for such violations*

The Qui Tam or “whistleblower” provision is described in §3730. If an individual knows of a violation of the [[False Claims Act|FCA]], he or she may bring a civil action on behalf of him or herself and on behalf of the U.S. government (such an individual is called a *relator*). If the government intervenes, it has the primary responsibility for prosecuting the Qui Tam action. The relator may be awarded 15–25 percent of the dollar amount recovered through the Qui Tam action, depending on the extent to which the relator contributed to the prosecution. If the government declines to intervene in the action, the relator’s share is increased to 25 to 30 percent. Since 1986, recoveries in Qui Tam actions have exceeded $18 billion. 

Common defendants in Qui Tam actions are government contractors and subcontractors; colleges and universities; medical care providers, such as physicians, clinics, and hospitals; [[Health Maintenance Organization|health maintenance organizations]] (HMOs); and federal grantees. 

The statute seeks to protect possible relators who come forward with information of wrongdoing. §3730 h.1, states that a relator shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make him or her whole if he or she is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment because of lawful acts done by the relator in furtherance of the efforts to stop violations.
