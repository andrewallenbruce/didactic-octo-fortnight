# Medicaid
*U.S. government program, financed by federal, state, and local funds, of hospitalization and medical insurance for persons of all ages within certain income limits.*

Medicaid is a health insurance program for low-income individuals and families who cannot afford healthcare costs. There are different types of Medicaid coverage available for individuals with different needs. Primary oversight is performed federally, but each state establishes its own eligibility standards, determines the type and scope of services, sets the rate of payment for services, and administers its own Medicaid program.

## Medicaid Eligibility
A person may be eligible for Medicaid if he or she:

- Is a U.S. citizen or provides proof of eligible immigration status, unless applying for emergency services.
- Has a Social Security number or has applied for one.
- Meets the requirements for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.
- Is a child under the age of 6 whose family incomes are at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL).
- Is a pregnant woman with family income below 133 percent of the FPL.
- Receives Supplemental Security Income (SSI).
- Is a recipient of adoption or foster care assistance under Title IV of the Social Security Act.
- Falls under a special protected group such as those who lose cash assistance due to earnings from work or from increased Social Security benefits.
- Is born after September 30, 1983, under 19, and in a family with incomes at or below the FPL.

States may choose to provide Medicaid coverage to other groups that share some characteristics with those above, but are more broadly defined, like the aged, blind, or disabled adults with incomes below the FPL, or low-income institutionalized individuals.

## Medicaid Coverage, Deductibles, and Coinsurances
Although the individual states decide what their Medicaid plans will cover, there are some mandatory federal requirements that the state must meet to receive federal matching funds. These services include:

- Inpatient hospital services
- Outpatient hospital services
- Prenatal care
- Vaccines for children
- Physician services
- Nursing facility services for persons aged 21 or older
- Family planning services and supplies
- Rural health clinic services
- Home healthcare for persons eligible for skilled-nursing services
- Laboratory and X-ray services
- Pediatric and family nurse practitioner services
- Nurse-midwife services
- Federally qualified health-center (FQHC) services and ambulatory services
- Early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment (EPSDT) services for children under age 21

There are also 34 optional approved Medicaid services that a state may provide and receive matching federal funds for, including optometry services, clinic services, prosthetics, and physical therapy.

Medicaid provides some enrollees with benefits under a fee-for-service delivery system. [[CMS]] reviews all state plan reimbursement methodologies to make sure reimbursement is consistent with federal statutes and regulations. States usually develop their payment rates based on the costs of providing the service, a review of commercial payer reimbursement, and a percentage of what [[Medicare]] pays for equivalent services.

Many states now offer a [[Managed Care Organization|managed care]] program for Medicaid benefits as an option. In some states, the plans are a requirement for enrollees. These [[Managed Care Organization|managed care]] programs include:

- [[Managed Care Organization]] (MCOs): Like [[Health Maintenance Organization|HMOs]], these companies agree to provide most Medicaid benefits to enrollees in exchange for a monthly payment from the state.

- Limited benefit plans: These companies are like [[Health Maintenance Organization|HMOs]], but only provide one or two Medicaid benefits.

- Primary Care Case Managers: These are individual providers or groups of providers that agree to act as an individual’s [[primary care provider]]. They receive a small monthly payment for helping coordinate referrals and other medical services.

Some states use [[Managed Long-Term Services and Supports]] (MLTSS) to offer services. This type of program delivers long term services and supports through capitated Medicaid [[Managed Care Organization|managed care]] programs. The number of states with these types of programs is increasing.

States have the option to charge premiums and out-of-pocket spending requirements for enrollees, which may include copayments, coinsurances, deductibles, and other similar charges. Certain groups, like pregnant women and children, are exempt from most out-of-pocket costs and cannot be charged coinsurances and copayments for certain services.

## Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)
The [[Children’s Health Insurance Program]], or CHIP, is designed to offer free or low-cost health insurance coverage to those whose incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid but can’t afford private coverage. It is administered by the states like Medicaid but is jointly funded by the federal government and the states. Every state administers its own [[Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)|CHIP]] program
with broad guidance from [[CMS]]. States can design their CHIP program through Medicaid expansion, through a separate child health insurance program, or a combination of the two. The [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|ACA]] maintains the [[Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)|CHIP]] eligibility standards through 2019.

## Spenddown Program
Some people may qualify for the spenddown program under Medicaid. This program is available for people who earn too high an income or have too many assets to qualify for Medicaid. Spenddown is similar to a [[deductible]]. The person pays for the cost of their medical care up to a set amount each month which can be made up of medical care bills, drugs, and medical supplies. Once the monthly spenddown amount has been met, a medical card will be issued to pay any other medical services the patient needs for the month. The amount of the spenddown will be different for each person and is based on an individual’s income and assets. The types of medical expenses that can be counted toward a patient’s spenddown include:

- Physician services
- Hospital services
- Nursing home services
- Clinic services
- Dentist services
- Podiatrist services
- Chiropractor services
- Medicines, medical supplies, and equipment prescribed by a provider
- Eyeglasses
- Medical or personal care in the home
- Health insurance premiums, including [[Medicare]] premiums
- Speech, occupational, and physical therapy
- Transportation to and from medical care
- Co-payments or deductibles paid for medical care

Unpaid medical bills, up to six months prior to the month they are counted for, may be used to meet the spenddown, as can bills paid for by someone other than the patient. Any medical bills for the patient or any person that the patient is legally responsible for (spouse, children under the age 18) may be used to meet the spenddown. Bills can be used for the month they were accrued and for up to six months afterwards. For example, if a patient pays for medication in April, the receipt may be used to meet the spenddown in April, or any month through September of that same year. A bill can only be used once to meet spenddown. A bill that is larger than the spenddown may be used to meet multiple months’ spenddown. For example, if a patient has a spenddown of $20 and has receipts for $60, it can be used to meet the spenddown for three months. A patient also chooses what month they want their spenddown used for. If a patient meets their spenddown on July 25, they can use the spenddown for August.

Make sure that you give patients receipts for all services that are on a spenddown, so they may turn them in to their caseworker.
