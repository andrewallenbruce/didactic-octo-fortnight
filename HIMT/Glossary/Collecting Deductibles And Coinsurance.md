Almost every insurance plan in the country has a deductible the patient needs to meet, prior to the benefits of the plan paying reimbursement. For instance, we had a private policy that had a $10,000 deductible that must be met prior to the carrier paying anything. Medicare Part B has a $203 deductible (in 2021) that applies to E&M, procedures and diagnostic tests. Their deductible does not apply to the following:

-   Screening mammography
    
-   Clinical diagnostic laboratory tests (including specimen collection fees) performed or supervised by a physician, laboratory, or other entity paid on an assigned basis
    
-   Pneumococcal vaccine and its administration
    
-   Influenza vaccine and its administration; and
    
-   Services or items denied as medically unnecessary
    
-   Welcome to Medicare (IPPE) physical
    
-   Medicare Annual Wellness Visits
    
-   Many other services related to preventive care
    

So, when the Medicare patient is about to leave your office, after seeing the doctor, the receptionist should:

1.  Determine whether the patient has met their deductible or not (if it’s within the first few days of the year, it’s probable that the patient has not met their deductible for the new year) and note the amount of the deductible (In 2021, it is $203 for Medicare Part B services)
    
2.  Review the Medicare allowed for the office visit and any procedures performed and if the deductible has NOT been met, apply those amounts towards the deductible. As an example, if the Office visit has a Medicare allowed of $53.50 and the removal of impacted cerumen has an allowed of $24.50, you would total the 2 allowed to $78.00 and since that is below the $147 deductible, you’d ask the patient to pay the $78.00 today. Yes – in spite of what you may have heard at the Laundromat or the latest office manager meeting, you ARE allowed to collect the deductible at the time of service, if you know the patient has not met it.  
      
    When you file the claim, the first $147 will apply to the deductible, and there is no reason why you should have to go to the trouble of preparing a statement, folding it, placing it in the envelope and then having to spend postage to send the statement to collect what you can and should collect today while the patient is in front of you. It is much easier to collect the deductible and coinsurance in the office than it is through the mail or while the patient is in the hospital (“yes, doctor, I want you to go through the patient’s purse while she is in a coma on your hospital rounds and collect $147 from her and leave this receipt in her wallet” may not be acceptable practice yet).  
      
    Along these same lines, if the patient HAS met their deductible, then you should collect 20% of the Medicare allowed on the visit and procedures and diagnostics while the patient is present – unless the patient has a co-insurance, supplemental insurance or Medigap plan, in which case the deductible and/or coinsurance may be paid by them after Medicare automatically forwards the EOB to them.
    
3.  If your insurance carrier or the patient tells you that you are not allowed to collect the co-pay, coinsurance or deductible at the time of service, make them PROVE their statement with something in writing that is official. I have NEVER seen a policy that prohibited it – in spite of hearing that they exist. In every instance when I asked to see the contract language that prohibited it, no one has ever been able to present it to me.
