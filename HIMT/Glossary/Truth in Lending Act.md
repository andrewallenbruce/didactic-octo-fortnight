# Truth in Lending Act (TILA)
*Designed to assure that every customer who needs consumer credit is given meaningful information concerning the cost of such credit*

The Consumer Credit Protection Act of 1968, also called the *Truth in Lending Act*, is a federal law that was enacted in 1968. It was designed to protect consumers in their dealings with lenders or creditors.

## Finance Charge Assessment
According to the TILA, if the practice regularly extends credit which is payable by agreement in more than four installments, or for which a finance charge is or may be required, they are considered a creditor and are subject to the rules of the Act. If the practice assesses finance charges on statements, the amount of the finance charge must be disclosed as an annual percentage rate.

If the practice sets up payment plans with patients that extend past four installments, the following information must be disclosed to the patient (as applicable):

- The “cash price” of the service,
- The amount of any down payment,
- The resulting unpaid balance,
- The total amount financed,
- The amount of the finance charge,
- The annual percentage rate of the finance charge,
- The total price to be paid under the credit plan,
- The schedule of payments, including number, amount, and due dates of payments,
- The sum of such scheduled payments, or total of payments, and
- The amount or method of computing the amount of any late payment charges.

If the practice refers patients to an outside finance company for large balances, more extensive disclosure of information to the patient would be required.
