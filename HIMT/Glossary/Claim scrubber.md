# Claim scrubber
*A software program that reviews [[Claim Form|claims]] for key components before the claims are presented to an insurance company.*

A claim scrubber is a software program that reviews claims for key components and flags any detected errors before claims are sent to an insurance company. The medical biller is often tasked with the responsibility to monitor and respond appropriately to any identified errors. Correcting the identified errors at this point in claims processing is the key to reduce, if not eliminate, the number of rejected or denied claims a practice receives.

Common edits that are identified by claim scrubbers are data entry errors. The patient demographic data is an area where mistakes are commonly found. For example, keying in an incorrect procedure code that is gender specific would be an error that the scrubber would flag. Edits check for a valid patient name and subscriber ID number.

The claim scrubber verifies [[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]]®/[[HCPCS Level II|HCPCS]] Level II codes and ICD-10-CM codes. The scrubber looks at the procedure code and diagnosis code to justify the [[medical necessity]] of the procedure. Additional edits may include the gender, age, date of service, place of service, required [[modifiers]], and [[National Correct Coding Initiative|NCCI]] edits. The claim scrubber will also verify that the ICD-10-CM codes support [[medical necessity]] and identify bundled services, if this is built into the system.

Some practice management systems can build in [[medical necessity]] policies based on the insurance carrier. This can be cumbersome to maintain. A more manageable process is to have the [[National Coverage Determination|NCDs]] and [[Local Coverage Determination|LCDs]] for your area loaded in the system and maintained as many insurance carriers will follow [[CMS]] guidelines.

Claim scrubber systems may be utilized at multiple points within the billing process. Claims may be scrubbed within the medical billing department prior to submitting to the clearinghouse, and then again by the clearinghouse before submitting to the payer.

The skilled medical biller will understand the nature of edits identified by the claims scrubber and know how to remedy errors appropriately. Applying their knowledge of coding concepts and payer policies will increase the professional
medical biller’s value to a medical practice. Their value will be realized as claims will be submitted accurately and [[Timely Filing|timely]], allowing for the practice to maintain a healthy revenue flow.
