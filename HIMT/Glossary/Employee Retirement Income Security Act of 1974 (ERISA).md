# Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)
The *Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974* (ERISA) is a federal United States tax and labor law that establishes minimum standards for pension plans in private industry. Contains rules on the federal income tax effects of transactions associated with employee benefit plans. Enacted to protect the interests of employee benefit plan participants and their beneficiaries. Applies to all non-government and non-church employers, does not apply to Medicare, Medicaid, or Worker's Comp.

# What Does It Have To Do with Health Insurance Claims?

Providers send money back to carriers regularly because carriers demand it even though they may not be entitled to it. And if you don’t fight it, they often recoup the money they claim is overpaid from future claims.

As an employee, your compensation package includes benefits, one of which may be health insurance provided by your employer. As such, this law affects most of the health insurance claims dealt with on a daily basis (more than 80% of the non-Medicare and non-Medicaid claims)

When an employer provides health insurance to an employee - it falls within the "compensation" arena, the same way the salary, vacation, holidays, overtime, etc. does. This means the patient and insurance policy is NOW protected by the federal government and the 1974 ERISA law - which is a GREAT thing for medical providers, hospitals and clinics.

About 83% of ALL non Medicare and non Medicaid medical claims fall within the ERISA purview.  If the insurance is provided by a non government or non church employer, the policy is ERISA. That's a good thing for you and the patient as it gives the patient's policy more protection. This means people working for Walmart, Exxon, Mobil, Carrier, Fedex, and every other non church and non government employer have ERISA policies!

# The Medical Side of ERISA

Conditioning by Payers: Most healthcare finance teams are used to payers setting the rules around payment, eligibility, and medical necessity. The reality is that, in many cases, ERISA trumps health plan contract terms and state regulations.

Contrary to what you thought - YOU don't have any claims. It's NOT your policy and it's NOT your claim. It is the PATIENT'S claim - and that is great news for you as that claim is protected by the Department of Labor, whereas if it was YOUR claim - it would have zero protection. If it's an ERISA claim, then the state insurance laws do NOT help and they do NOT apply. The federal protections take precedence over state laws, state insurance regulations, and even the contract you may have been dumb enough to sign with the carrier.  Your contract cannot interfere with the federal protections that the claim has.

You "think" you have a timely filing limit of 90 days or 120 days with a carrier. That claim, that belongs to the patient, that you filed does NOT have that timely limit.  Your contract with the carrier means NOTHING since the patient's policy is ALL that matters and most patient policies have 180 days or 1 year and some even have 2 years.

Insurance carriers are counting on the fact that less than 5% of people in medical offices or hospitals know anything about ERISA. They know they can't legally recoup -but they do it anyway. They know the timely filing limit in your contract means nothing on more than 80% of the claims you file to them - but they know that most medical offices and hospitals are ignorant of that fact.

The claim is NOT your claim. It's the patient's claim - and therefore it's the patient's money.  The Supreme Court has ruled several times that if the carrier wants money back - they have to get it from the patient - and NOT the medical provider. BUT THEY RECOUPED FROM ME ANYWAY. Of course they did. They banked (literally) on the fact that you were ignorant about ERISA - yet you could have stopped them from getting an insurance carrier refund from you very easily. It's probably not too late to get them to refund you the money they recouped. They don't want to be sued like BCBS was. That case ended up with the carrier paying more than $350 Million - and they don't want to pay that again.

The fact they mailed the check to you means NOTHING - regardless of the lies told to you by the insurance carrier in the letter they send you full of false information.

# WHAT ELSE DOES ERISA AFFECT?

ERISA can make the carrier pay when they don't want to.

ERISA can stop the carrier from down-coding the claim anytime they wish.

ERISA can stop the carrier from making up ridiculous bundling policies.

ERISA can stop a carrier from claiming a service is investigational or experimental,

Keep in mind that less than 7% of the US workforce works for the government and about 1% work for a church entity so only about 8% of the workforce are exempt from ERISA. That means 92% of the rest are subject to ERISA

ERISA gives those claims the protections of the federal government

ERISA can be used to STOP carriers from recouping previously paid claims, delayed denials, and how to use ERISA to make carriers pay even when they don’t want to. You’ll learn how to use ERISA to keep carriers honest, by making them follow their own plan documents, which is something most billers don’t know about or follow through on.

Learn how to effectively dispute these overpayment demands, learn to identify ERISA plans and learn the correct basic ERISA Appeals Process that will unravel the confusion surrounding ERISA.

The 1974 federal ERISA law applies to every one of those claims and that law gives protections to the patients - and those protections apply to the clinic, the physician, and the hospital when the patient has assigned their rights to the medical provider. Those rights trump anything the doctor may have signed with the carrier. For instance, the doc may THINK that they have a 90-day filing deadline - but if it's an ERISA claim, it might be a year, as it's whatever the patient's POLICY says. The contract the doc signed means nothing as the policy is ALL THAT MATTERS.

When you get a refund demand from a carrier - you can stop the carrier from recouping if it's an ERISA claim. When you get a timely filing denial from the carrier - you can make the carrier pay if it's an ERISA claim. When you get a denial for a service being investigational or experimental, you might still be able to make the carrier pay, if it's an ERISA claim.
