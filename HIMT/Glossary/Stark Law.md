# Stark Law
*A federal law that places limitations of certain physician referrals*

The Stark Act is an amendment to the Social Security Act that prohibits physicians from “self-referral” when sending patients elsewhere for certain services. The Stark Law prohibits a physician from making a [[Referring Provider|referral]] for certain designated health services (DHS) to an entity in which the physician (or an immediate member of his family) has an ownership/investment interest or with which he or she has a compensation arrangement, unless an exception applies. Self-referral of [[Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] patients to a facility in which the physician has a vested interest can be considered a conflict of interest and is meant as method of controlling over-utilization of services.

One exception allows for a physician that is a member of a group practice to refer a patient for imaging (CT, MRI, PET) within the group practice without violating Stark. A physician referring a patient within the group practice must provide the patient, at the time of the [[Referring Provider|referral]], a list of alternate locations to receive the services or supplies. This exception only applies to those operating within a group practice.

A financial relationship includes direct or indirect ownership of an entity, as well as stock options, partnership interests, and compensation agreements.

The penalties for violation of the Stark Law range from civil penalties of $15,000 (before annual inflation adjustment) for each violation, and up to three times the amount of the improper payment involved in the violation. The violation can also carry the risk for [[False Claims Act | False Claim liability]] which is discussed later in this chapter.

The Stark Law is similar to the [[Anti-kickback Law]] and is governed by Health and Human Services (HHS) (42 USC § 1395nn). It is not the same, however.
