# Deductible
*An annual specified dollar amount the policyholder must pay before the insurance carrier begins paying for services.*

The amount you pay for covered health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay. With a $2,000 deductible, for example, you pay the first $2,000 of covered services yourself.

After you pay your deductible, you usually pay only a [[Copay|copayment]] or coinsurance for covered services. Your insurance company pays the rest.

Generally, plans with lower monthly premiums have higher deductibles. Plans with higher monthly premiums usually have lower deductibles.
