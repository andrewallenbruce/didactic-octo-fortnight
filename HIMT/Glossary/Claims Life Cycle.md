# Claims Life Cycle
*The life cycle of a claim is the process a health insurance claim goes through from the time the claim is submitted by the provider until it is paid by the insurance carrier.*

The life cycle of a claim consists of four stages: 
1. claims submission and [[Electronic Data Interchange]] (EDI)
2. [[Claim Form|claims]] processing
3. claims [[Adjudication]]
4. payment/denial

Subtitle D of the HITECH Act addresses the privacy and security concerns associated with the electronic transmission of health information.

Each practice can submit claims either directly to the insurance carrier or through a clearinghouse. Most practices utilize the services of a clearinghouse to submit claims instead of submitting the claims directly to the payer. The clearinghouse will send the batch of claims through an editing process and return claims to the provider for corrections prior to the claim being sent to the insurance carrier. A clearinghouse report shows when a claim has been received by the payer and may contain notes from the payer such as a patient not eligible for the date of service. If during the clearinghouse editing process an error is identified, the clearinghouse report will indicate the issue. The office must pay attention to this report, correct any errors, and resubmit the claim. The payer cannot pay a claim that was not received due to it being stopped by the edits at the clearinghouse level.

Once the claim makes it past the clearinghouse to the payer, the data file is processed and converted to a claim form for the claims analyzer or claims adjudicator to review. Most insurance payers have automated systems to automatically pay or deny services based on a set of rules or logic the payer builds into their processing system.
