# Preferred Provider Organization (PPO)
*[[Managed Care Organization]] of medical doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers who have agreed with an insurer or a third-party administrator to provide healthcare at reduced rates to the insurer’s or administrator’s clients*

A PPO is a type of insurance plan that allows members to choose the doctors and hospitals they want to visit from providers within the network (preferred providers). Unlike [[Health Maintenance Organization|HMOs]], patients are not required to obtain prior approval or go through a [[Gatekeeper]] if they wish to see a specialist. They also are not required to choose a [[Primary Care Provider]]. If they choose not to see a preferred provider, the services are still covered, but the patient will pay more out-of-pocket costs as the services provided by non-participating providers are reimbursed at a lower rate. These types of plans usually have a [[Deductible]] and coinsurance responsibility. In some cases, they may need to obtain prior approval for non-emergency hospital visits and outpatient surgery.

## Example: In-Network vs. OON Cost for a PPO
| Benefit Plan Feature | In-Network Cost | OON Cost      |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Annual [[Deductible]]    |                 |               |
| Individual/Family    | $2500/$5000     | $6000/$12000  |
| Annual OOP Max       |                 |               |
| Individual/Family    | $7500/$15000    | $16000/$32000 |
