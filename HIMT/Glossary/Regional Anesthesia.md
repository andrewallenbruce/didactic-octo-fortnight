# Regional Anesthesia
*A loss of sensation in a region of the body*

## Three Types
1. Spinal Anesthesia: An anesthetic agent is injected in the subarachnoid space into the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in the patientâ€™s spinal canal for surgeries performed below the upper abdomen.
2. Epidural Anesthesia: An anesthetic agent is injected in the epidural space. A small catheter may be placed for a continuous epidural. An epidural can also remain in place after surgery to assist with postoperative pain.
3. Nerve Block: An anesthetic agent is injected directly into the area around a nerve to block sensation for the region the surgery is being performed. Commonly used for procedures on the arms or legs.
