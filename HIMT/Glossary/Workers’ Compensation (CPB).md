# Workers’ Compensation
## Introduction
Workers’ Compensation is a benefit program that requires an employer to pay, or provide insurance to pay, for the lost wages and medical expenses of an employee who is injured on the job. The workers’ compensation law is unique to each state. The specifics of the law can vary but the key features are consistent.

Under workers’ compensation, an employee is automatically entitled to receive certain benefits when he or she suffers an occupational disease or accidental personal injury arising out of, or during, employment. Benefits may include cash or wage-loss benefits, medical and career rehabilitation benefits, and in the case of accidental death of an employee, benefits to dependents.

Independent contractors are not entitled to workers’ compensation benefits, and in some states domestic workers and agricultural workers are excluded or only partially covered.

## Purpose and Scope
Workers’ compensation is considered a no-fault insurance program, meaning an injured employee will receive benefits regardless of who was at fault (the employer, the employee, a patient, etc.). In exchange for these benefits, the worker cannot bring a civil action against the employer for pain and suffering or other damages, except in cases of intentional acts.

## Segregation of Documentation
Workers’ compensation insurance payers and the state compensation boards/commissions are allowed by law to review only treatment data and history pertaining to the patient’s on-the-job injury. Maintaining separate charts for workers’ compensation injuries is essential to ensure the correct information is being submitted.

According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the HIPAA Privacy Rule does not apply to entities that are either workers’ compensation insurers, workers’ compensation administrative agencies, or employers, except to the extent they may otherwise be covered entities. However, these entities need access to the health information of individuals who are injured on the job or who have a work-related illness to process or adjudicate claims, or to coordinate care under workers’ compensation systems. Generally, this health information is obtained from healthcare providers who treat these individuals and who may be covered by the Privacy Rule. The Privacy Rule recognizes the legitimate need of insurers and other entities involved in the workers’ compensation system to have access to individuals’ health information as authorized by state or other law.

Providers who treat patients for workers’ compensation injuries or illness must create a separate chart for documentation of the work-related injury and treatment. This prevents any documentation of the patient’s non-work-related issues from being disclosed to the workers’ compensation insurance and the state compensation boards/commissions.

title: Billing
It is important to keep the work related and non-work-related documentation separate. If paper charts are utilized, having a separate chart for the work-related injury is required. Make the chart a different color to make it easy to identify. If EHR/EMR is used, open a separate progress note and identify it in a way that will make it easy to recognize the work-related injury.

## Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA)
Congress created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Labor, with the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. This department was created to assure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women by setting and enforcing standards and by providing training, outreach, education, and assistance. OSHA covers most employees in the country. It covers private sector employees and, in some cases, state and local employees. Those not covered by OSHA include the self-employed, immediate family members of farm employers that do not employ outside workers, and injuries covered by another federal agency (for example, the Coast Guard).

According to OSHA, the healthcare and social assistance industry have more work-related injuries and illness than any other sector. In 2017, the healthcare and social assistance industry reported 582,800 work related injury or illness cases. That is 153,900 more cases than the next highest industry sector, which is manufacturing. Nurse’s aides, orderlies, and attendants had the highest rate of musculoskeletal disorders of all occupations. The incidence rate of work-related musculoskeletal disorders in healthcare/social assistance was 166.3 per 10,000 workers, compared to 30.5 average for all other workers in 2017.

Healthcare workers include medical staff, maintenance, housekeeping, food service, laundry, and administrative staff. Healthcare workers face many serious safety and health hazards. These hazards include bloodborne pathogens and biological hazards, potential chemical and drug exposures, waste anesthetic gas exposures, respiratory hazards, ergonomic hazards from lifting and repetitive tasks, laser hazards, workplace violence, hazards associated with laboratories, and radioactive material and X-ray hazards. Some of the potential chemical exposures include formaldehyde, used for preservation of specimens for pathology; ethylene oxide, glutaraldehyde, and parasitic acid, used for sterilization; and numerous other chemicals used in healthcare laboratories.

OSHA has developed standards and directives to protect workers against transmission of infectious agents. These include OSHA’s Bloodborne Pathogens standard (29 CFR 1910.1030), which provides protection of workers from exposure to blood and body fluids that may contain bloodborne infectious agents; OSHA’s Personal Protective Equipment standard (29 CFR 1910.132) and Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134), which provide protection for workers when exposed to contact, droplet, and airborne transmissible infectious agents; and OSHA’s TB compliance directive, which protects workers against exposure to TB through enforcement of existing applicable OSHA standards and the General Duty Clause of the OSHA Act.

Healthcare workers who may encounter blood and infectious material must be properly trained to avoid contamination when handling infectious materials and when exposed to human blood. This includes training on the use of standard precautions and being offered hepatitis B vaccinations and testing for TB.

## Coverage and Provider Reimbursement
To qualify for workers’ compensation, an employee must be injured while working within the scope of their job description, injured while performing services required by the employer, or contract an illness that can be directly connected to employment.

```ad-Example
title: EXAMPLE
A nurse working in the emergency department was administering an injection to a patient when she had an accidental needle stick. The patient is HIV positive. Testing after the injury determined the nurse is now HIV positive. This injury and subsequent illness would be covered under workers’ compensation.

## Payment of Premiums
Federal and state laws require employers to maintain workers’ compensation coverage. The employer is required to pay for or provide insurance to cover the lost wages and medical expenses of an employee who is injured on the job. The employer is required to pay the premiums and any deductible for insurance coverage, not the employee.

Federal employees are covered under one of the federal workers’ compensation programs. These programs include Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program, Federal Employees’ Compensation Program, Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Program, and Black Lung Benefits.

### Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program (EEOICP)
Provides lump-sum compensation and health benefits for eligible Department of Energy nuclear weapons workers (including employees, former employees, contractors, and subcontractors) injured on the job. The EEOICP provides lump-sum compensation to certain survivors if the worker is deceased. The program has two parts. Part B provides eligible employees or their survivors with lump-sum compensation in amounts up to $150,000, along with medical expenses for accepted conditions. To be eligible for Part B, an employee must have sustained a radiogenic cancer, chronic silicosis, beryllium sensitivity, or chronic beryllium disease while working at a covered Department of Energy facility, atomic weapons employer, or a beryllium vendor during specified time periods. Part E provides eligible employees or their survivors with compensation in amounts up to $250,000, along with medical expenses for accepted
conditions. Amounts of benefits are based on the level of impairment of the employee and/or years of qualifying wage loss related to covered illness. To be eligible for Part E, an employee must have developed a covered illness because of exposure to any toxic substance at a Department of Energy facility or RECA Section 5 mine or mill.

### Federal Employees’ Compensation Program
The Federal Employees’ Compensation Act (FECA) provides workers’ compensation coverage to three million federal and postal workers around the world for employment-related injuries and occupational diseases. The Division of Federal Employees’ Compensation (DFEC) adjudicates new claims for benefits and manages ongoing cases. It also pays medical expenses and compensation benefits to injured workers and survivors and helps injured employees return to work when they are medically able to do so.

During the 2017 FY, the program paid $2.946 billion in benefits to approximately 222,616 workers and survivors for work-related injuries or illnesses (over $1.852 billion in wage-loss (disability) compensation, $936 million for medical and rehabilitation services, and $157 million for death benefit payments).

All medical authorizations and claims processing are handled by a contractor, which at this writing is ACS. ACS provides an online tool at https://www.dol.gov/owcp/dfec/regs/compliance/WebPortal.htm where injured workers, medical providers, or employing agencies can:

- Check Eligibility on a patient to see if authorization is required for specific procedures, check claim requirements.
- Check Authorization to check if authorization has been approved before receiving the authorization letter. Providers can request authorizations online, and for routine care, may receive authorizations online.
- Check Bill Payment to check the status on claims and reimbursement requests, or the status of submitted bills and reimbursement requests. Providers can also view Remittance Vouchers (RVs) online.

To be reimbursed for treating federal employees under FECA, a provider must enroll with the program. Any claims for a provider not enrolled will be returned along with enrollment instructions. Enrollment is available online at https://owcpmed.dol.gov/portal/inquiry/provEnrollStatus.do.

### Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Program (LHWCP)
The Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation
Program provides workers’ compensation benefits to
most waterfront workers and contractors working overseas
for the U.S. government. The Longshore and Harbor Workers’
Compensation Act (LHWCA)is a federal law that provides for
the payment of compensation, medical care, and vocational
rehabilitation services for workers disabled from injuries on
the job on navigable waters of the U.S., or adjoining areas used
customarily in the loading, unloading, repairing, or building
of a vessel. It also provides for the payment of survivor
benefits to dependents if a work injury causes, or contributes
to, the employee’s death. Under this act, injury may include
occupational disease, hearing loss, and illness arising from
employment.

The LHWCA covers workers in traditional maritime occupations,
such as longshore workers, shipbuilders, ship-repairers,
and harbor construction workers. Congress extended the
LHWCA to include other types of employment, such as:
ll Employees at overseas military bases of the U.S. and
to employees of U.S. government contractors working
outside the U.S. in public work projects or in national
defense and military operations
ll Employees working on the Outer Continental Shelf of
the U.S. in the exploration and development of natural
resources (for example offshore drilling rigs)
ll Civilian employees of non-appropriated fund
instrumentalities of the Armed Forces (for example
military base exchanges and recreational facilities)
The LHWCA specifically excludes seamen, employees of
the U.S. government or of any state or foreign government,
employees whose injuries were caused solely by their intoxication,
and employees whose injuries were due to their own
willful intention to harm themselves or others.

### Federal Black Lung Program
The Federal Black Lung
Program is an act providing compensation and medical
coverage for treatment to coal miners who are totally disabled
by pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment, and to survivors of coal miners whose deaths are attributable
to the disease. Pneumoconiosis, or black lung disease, is
caused by inhaling coal dust. There are two types: simple and
complicated pneumoconiosis. With this condition, the lung is
damaged by coal dust, inflaming the walls of lungs’ air sacs.
This causes the lungs to stiffen from scarring of the tissue
between the air sacs. There is no known cure, only treatment of
symptoms and complications.

The program is administered by the Division of Coal Mine
Workers’ Compensation through the U.S. Department of
Labor. Below is an example of a Black Lung Benefit Identification
Card.

The Federal Black Lung Program covers medical treatment,
services, and associated travel for the treatment of a condition covered under the Benefits Act. There is no deductible or
copayment due from the patient. Services that may be covered
for treatment of a black lung condition include:

ll Provider visits (including office, hospital, and
consultations)
ll Inpatient and outpatient charges (including emergency
department visit for acute black lung related conditions,
diagnostic tests, X-rays, etc.)
ll Approved prescription drugs
ll Ambulance services limited to transportation for
emergency acute black lung related care
ll Travel to the provider, hospital, clinic, or other medical
facility for round trips not to exceed 200 miles

There are also other services that require special approval,
including rental of home medical equipment, pulmonary
rehabilitation, and home healthcare visits. For patients who
also have Medicare, Medicare is a secondary payer to the Black
Lung Program for covered conditions.

Individuals injured on the job while employed by private
companies or state and local government agencies would
be covered by insurance payers through their state workers’
compensation board. The workers’ compensation law is
governed by each state. The specific details of the law may vary,
but the key features are consistent.

State workers’ compensation law includes the following types
of coverage:

State Insurance Fund— An agency that provides workers’
compensation insurance coverage to private and public
employers and acts as an agent in state workers’ compensation
cases involving state employees. A listing of each
state’s workers’ compensation official with a link to the
respective state’s webpage can be found at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dfec/regs/compliance/wc.htm.

Self-Insurance Plans—Employers with adequate capital
to qualify can self-insure. Self-insurance plans require
the employer to set aside a state-mandated percentage of
capital funds to cover medical expenses, wage compensation,
and other benefits payable to employees who have an
on-the-job injury and/or illness.

Commercial Workers’ Compensation Insurance—
Commercial insurance companies that meet state
mandates for workers’ compensation coverage can offer
policies for employers to purchase.

Combination Programs—In some states, employers can
choose a combination of any of the above to comply with
workers’ compensation coverage requirements.

Reimbursement Requirements for Providers
Providers are required to accept reimbursement from workers’
compensation payers as payment in full. Providers may not bill
the patient for the balance between the amount charged and
the reimbursement from the workers’ compensation payer.

Claims Completion
When an employee is injured on the job, a claim is filed with
the employer’s workers’ compensation carrier. Once a claim is
filed, the date of injury/illness is established, and the employee
is assigned a claim number. This claim number acts as the
equivalent of an insurance ID number when filing medical
claims for reimbursement.

When a patient presents to the physician for a workers’
compensation injury, information surrounding the claim is
submitted with the claim for reimbursement. The patient may
bring the information with them to the visit. If the patient does
not provide the necessary information, the provider’s office
must contact the patient’s employer to collect the information
needed to complete the First Report of Injury form. Each state
may have a different form. The page to follow is a copy of the
Illinois Form 45: Employer’s First Report of Injury.

The information needed to submit a claim includes:
ll Patient name, date of birth, social security number,
address, and phone number
ll Employer’s name, address, and phone number
ll Workers’ compensation carrier address, phone number,
and claim number
ll Injury information such as date of injury, place of injury,
and detailed explanation of how the injury occurred

The claim will be submitted to the workers’ compensation
payer in paper format using a CMS 1500 claim form. A First
Report of Injury form and the progress note for the encounter
must also be submitted with the paper claim.

Four copies of the First Report of Injury form are needed for
distribution to the following:
ll State workers’ compensation board/commission
ll Employer’s designated compensation payer
ll Employer of the ill or injured employee
ll Patient’s chart in the work-related injury section

The filing deadline for the first report of injury is determined
by state law. The deadline for filing of the claim for services
will vary by payer.

It is important to submit the correct CPT® and HCPCS Level
II codes. Workers’ compensation carriers are not covered entities
under HIPAA, which means the carriers are not required
to accept the current code set. Some workers’ compensation
carriers will require codes from previous years because the
systems are not updated yearly. This means that the carrier
may not accept ICD-10-CM codes and the claim will need
to be submitted with ICD-9-CM codes instead. The correct
code set to use can be determined by contacting the workers’
compensation carrier.

BILLING TIP
Contact the patient’s employer immediately to ensure the
patient has notified the employer of the injury/illness and to
verify a claim has been filed with the workers’ compensation
payer.
