# Healthcare Reimbursement Account (HRA)
*An employer-funded plan that reimburses employees for incurred medical expenses that are not covered by the company’s standard insurance plan.*

With an HRA, an employer can offer tax free reimbursement of an employee’s health insurance premiums paid for by an employer. It is an IRS-approved, tax-advantaged health benefit plan. They can be used to pay for covered expenses and non-covered qualified medical expenses, including insurance premiums, with after-tax dollars. The employer has full power over structuring the employee’s use of HRA funds. Unlike an [[Health Savings Account|HSA]] or [[Flexible Spending Account (FSA)|FSA]], there is no limit to the amount an employer can contribute to an employee’s healthcare reimbursement account. The account balances may also roll over from year to year. They can be used by former employees and retirees to continue to have access to unused reimbursement amounts. 

Eligible medical care expenses as defined by the IRS are those items and services that are meant to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent illness or disease, including transportation that is primarily for medical care. Examples include:
- Health plan deductibles
- Co-insurance and co-payments
- Eligible dental expenses, including exams, X-rays, and cleanings
- Eligible vision care, including exams, eyeglasses, contact lenses, and laser eye surgery
- Certain over-the-counter medications, if allowed by your plan
- Certain healthcare items, like band-aids, aspirin, antacids, laxatives, etc., if allowed by the plan and requirements are met

Ineligible expenses include:
- Cosmetic surgery and procedures
- Herbs, vitamins, and supplements for general health
- OTC medicines for which the member does not have a prescription
- Family or marriage counseling
- Personal use items (lip balm, shaving cream, moisturizer, etc.)
- Prescription drugs imported from another country
- Expenses reimbursed by another plan or program ([[Flexible Spending Account (FSA)|FSA]] or [[Health Savings Account|HSA]] account, etc.)
- Any other item or service that is not used for medical care as defined above by the IRS
