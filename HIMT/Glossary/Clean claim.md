# Clean claim
*A clean claim contains all required data elements needed to process and pay the claim. A claim with all the elements necessary to adjudicate the claim.*

The Code of Federal Regulations published by the United States government states a clean claim is: 
1. A claim that has no defect, impropriety, lack of any required substantiating documentation or particular circumstance requiring special treatment that prevents [[Timely Filing|timely]] payment; and
2. A claim that otherwise conforms to the clean claim requirements for equivalent claims under original [[Medicare]].

## Claims Generation
After the charges and payments are entered, claims are generated. The [[Practice Management System|PMS]] may send the charges through an editing system or a [[claim scrubber]] to verify all required components of the claim exist in the system. This creates a clean claim.

A clean claim contains all required data elements needed to process and pay the claim. Each insurance carrier will define the elements required for a clean claim. Prompt payment laws and state regulations define how quickly an insurance carrier must respond to a claim. The claim submitted is required to be a clean claim for the regulation to apply.
