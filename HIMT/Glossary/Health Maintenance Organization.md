# Health Maintenance Organization (HMO)
*An organization that provides comprehensive healthcare to voluntarily enrolled individuals and families in a geographic area by member physicians with limited referral to outside specialists, and that is financed by fixed periodic payments determined in advance.*

The Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Act of 1973 (P. L. 93-222) was proposed under the Nixon Administration to try to help control healthcare costs. It authorized $375 million to assist in establishing and expanding HMOs. The Act also overrode state laws that prohibited the establishment of prepaid health plans and required employers with 25 or more employees to offer an HMO option if they furnished healthcare coverage to their employees. According to the Rand Corporation, HMO enrollment went from three million in 1970 to over 80 million in 1999, representing a 12 percent increase every year.

The Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973 was signed by President Nixon on December 29, 1973. The Act authorized $375 million dollars over a five-year period to encourage development of HMOs with grants and contracts, loans, and loan guarantees. It also required employers to offer an HMO option in their health benefits plans offered to employees. HMOs are entities which provide basic health services to their enrollees for a fixed monthly payment. An HMO must also provide the option of supplemental health services to its enrollees. 

## Basic health services means:
- Physician services (including consultation and referral services by a physician)
- Inpatient and outpatient hospital services
- Medically necessary emergency health services
- Short-term outpatient evaluative and crisis intervention mental health services (not to exceed 20 visits)
- Medical treatment and referral services for the abuse of or addiction to alcohol and drugs
- Diagnostic laboratory and diagnostic and therapeutic radiologic services
- Home health services
- Preventive health services to include voluntary family planning services, infertility services, preventive dental care for children, and children’s eye exams conducted to determine the need for vision correction

## Supplemental health services means:
- Services of facilities for intermediate and long-term care
- Vision care not included as a basic health service
- Dental services not included as a basic health service
- Mental health services not included as a basic health service
- Long-term physical medicine and rehabilitative services to include physical therapy
- The provision of prescription drugs prescribed during the provision by the health maintenance organization of a basic health service

## HMO Models
### Group Model HMO
HMO that contracts with a multi-specialty group that provides care to the members. The HMO pays an established rate, which is distributed to the individual physicians as part of their salaries. The group may work solely with the HMO or may offer services to other patients. Care may be provided in facilities owned by the group or the HMO. The HMO pays the group in bulk and the group is responsible for reimbursing physician members and contracted facilities.
### Staff Model HMO (Closed-Panel HMO)
HMO that employs the physicians on salary to provide care to the members in the clinics and other facilities owned by the HMO. It is also called a closed-panel HMO, as the physicians are contracted to provide medical services to only HMO patients.
### Network Model HMO
HMO that contracts with more than one multi-specialty group, individual practice groups, and individual physicians so a variety of services may be offered to its members. This allows formation of a “provider network” and allows care to be provided in a larger geographic service area and offers the patient a choice of physicians and managed costs.
### Individual/Independent Practice Association (IPA) (aka Open-Panel HMO)
HMO that contracts with independent physicians who maintain their offices and provide services to HMO and non-HMO patients, for which they receive a fixed amount per patient. This is also called an open-panel HMO. With an IPA, primary care providers may refer patients to medical services outside the network, but the HMO may not provide as much coverage as if the patient would have stayed within the network.
### Mixed Model HMO
HMO that combines features of the individual practice association model and group models together. The HMO will contract with multi-specialty group practices, independent practice associations, and fully independent physicians all together. Mixed model HMOs offer the biggest variety of choices and largest geographic coverage area to its members, giving patients more choices of clinics, laboratories, pharmacies, and hospitals.
## [[Primary Care Provider]] (PCP) 
Upon joining an HMO, a member chooses a [[primary care provider]], or [[Primary Care Provider|PCP]]. This provider, sometimes called a [[Gatekeeper]], is responsible for providing a broad range of routine services. Their duty is to manage the member’s treatment, as they are responsible for the member’s healthcare decisions and referrals to other facilities (for example, inpatient admissions), in-network specialists, or out-of-network specialists when necessary. They are the group member’s primary contact with the health plan. Most plans require a referral, or the member is responsible for the cost of treatment. Each covered member of a family may choose a different PCP. A PCP is usually a family or general medicine provider, an internal medicine provider, or a pediatrician. PCP’s are the entry point for almost all the group member’s healthcare needs. They provide disease prevention, health promotion, health maintenance, counseling, patient education, and diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic illnesses.
