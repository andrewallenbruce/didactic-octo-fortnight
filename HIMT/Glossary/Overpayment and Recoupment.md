# Overpayment and Recoupment
An overpayment occurs when too much has been paid to a provider and a refund to [[Medicare]] is necessary.

Overpayments are either communicated to a provider via a Noridian Demand Letter **or** self-reported by a provider. To be in compliance with [[Medicare]] policies for reporting and repaying overpayments, selecting the appropriate payment method for each situation is critical.

Has a Demand Letter issued or is the overpayment is being voluntarily sent in to Noridian? The answer to these will determine which form, if necessary, should be completed and sent.

When determining a payment method, it is important to consider which form to use and the timeliness of when payment must be made.
