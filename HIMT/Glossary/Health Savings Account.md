# Health Savings Account (HSA)
*A savings account used in conjunction with a high-[[deductible]] health insurance policy that allows users to save money tax-free against medical expenses.*

HSAs were created in 2003. An HSA combines high [[deductible]] health insurance with a tax-advantaged savings account. The money deposited in the account can pay for the [[deductible]], and once met, the money left in the account earns interest. HSAs can be funded by employers or employees and they are portable, which means that the account stays with the employee if they change employers or leave the work force. They are tax-free income to employees, they accumulate tax free and are not taxed when withdrawn for eligible medical expenses, including for dental or vision expenses. To access the advantages of an HSA, Congress has imposed strict requirements, including (amounts for 2019 - updated annually):

- An individual must be covered under a high deductible health plan (deductible of at least $1,350 for individual or $2,700 for family) and caps on the out-of-pocket amounts that the individual will have to pay of $6,750 for individual coverage and $13,500 for family coverage

- The employee cannot be enrolled in [[Medicare]]

- An individual and/or employer can make contributions to the HSA up to the planâ€™s deductible, but no more than $3,500 for an individual or $7,000 for family for 2019

- Contributions may be made by the employee, the employer, family member, or any other person on behalf of the eligible individual

- The HSA annual contribution limit is greater than the otherwise applicable limit by $1,000 for policyholders and covered spouses age 55 and older

- Employers contributing to an HSA must make available comparable contributions on behalf of all employees with comparable coverage

- Distributions from an HSA that are for qualified medical expenses are excluded from gross income; those that are not qualified are included in gross income and have a 10 percent penalty if the distribution is taken prior to the age of 65
