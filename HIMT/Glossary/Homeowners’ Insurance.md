# Homeowners’ Insurance
*Definition*

There are different types of policies with homeowners’ insurance, No-fault insurance pays for healthcare services a patient needs because of an injury they suffer on their property, regardless of who is at fault. Liability insurance protects against claims for negligence that causes someone to get injured. Liability insurance includes medical payments to other’s coverage, which provides payment for necessary medical expenses for accidentally injured guests. No-fault insurance or liability insurance would be the primary insurance in these cases instead of a patient’s own medical insurance.

If the provider/office/practice/facility knows the patient has a no-fault or liability insurance claim, the claim should be filed to the no-fault or liability insurer first. In the case of a [[Medicare]] patient, if the insurance company does not pay the claim within 120 days, [[Medicare]] may be billed to make a conditional payment. A conditional payment means that [[Medicare]] will pay the bill, but [[Medicare]] must be repaid when a settlement, judgment award, or other payment is made. 

[[Medicare]] has a guide entitled, “[[Medicare]] and Other Health Benefits: Your Guide to Who Pays First.” This guide gives instruction on how [[Medicare]] coordinates with other types of coverage and which coverage should pay first. Below is a portion of a table from that guide that indicates primary coverage for liability and no-fault insurance.

```ad-Example
title: EXAMPLE Case
A patient presents with lacerations and puncture wounds to her arm. She states she was at her neighbor’s house for dinner and was bitten by their dog. She gives the office a copy of her neighbor’s homeowners’ insurance information and her commercial insurance card. The homeowners’ insurance is billed.

When a payer is billed and pays a claim incorrectly, the claim goes into [[Subrogation]]. This is when an insurance company attempts to [[Overpayment and Recoupment|recoup]] expenses for a paid claim when another payer should have been responsible. This is seen commonly in auto accidents and liability cases when the auto insurance or liability insurance is not provided by the patient during the visit.
