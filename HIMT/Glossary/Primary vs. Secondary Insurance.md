# Primary vs. Secondary Insurance
*Definition*

Patients may be covered under more than one health insurance policy. When this happens determine which insurance is primary and which is secondary. When a patient is the subscriber for their insurance coverage, this insurance payer is considered the patient’s primary insurance. If the patient is also covered under another insurance, for instance from a spouse, the spouse’s coverage would be the secondary insurance. 

When a child is covered by insurance plans from both parents, the [[birthday rule]] is used to determine the primary and secondary insurance. According to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, under the [[birthday rule]], the health plan of the parent whose birthday comes first in the calendar year is designated as the primary plan. The year of birth is not a factor in this rule. The month and day are the only factors the health plan considers. 

Billing secondary payers may be offered as a courtesy for patients or may be required depending on the office policy. Billing departments may designate billing staff that concentrate only on billing secondary [[Claim Form|claims]]. Secondary claims can be submitted once the primary payer has processed the initial claim. The remittance advice (RA) from the primary payer will accompany the claim to the secondary payer. Both primary and secondary payers will only reimburse for services or procedures that are qualified under the payer’s policy and that are demonstrated as medically necessary. Many group health insurance policies have a [[coordination of benefits]] provision in place to prevent multiple payers from paying benefits covered by other policies. 

Coordination of benefit provisions also define the order or sequencing of payment when more than one payer is involved. Some major payers have the capability to transfer primary claims data through electronic files to the secondary payer to facilitate the process. [[Medicare]] performs this process, which they call “crossover” claims.
