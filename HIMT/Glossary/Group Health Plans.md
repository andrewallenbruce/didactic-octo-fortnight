# Group Health Plans
*Health plans that are purchased by employers for its employees. A portion of the group health plan premium may be paid by the employer.*

The employer decides on the type of coverage and the costs. If an employer offers health insurance, it must be made available to all employees who are determined to be eligible by the employer’s standards. Employers decide how much of the premium they will pay and how much the employee, if any, must contribute. The [[HIPAA]] law of 1996 limited exclusions for pre-existing medical conditions which was followed by the preexisting condition exclusion under the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|ACA]]. A group health insurer cannot deny coverage to an eligible employee or family member because of a pre-existing condition. Common types of group insurance available include:
## Fully Insured Employer Group
The employer contracts directly with the insurance company to provide certificates to covered employees. The employer contracts with the health plan to assume financial responsibility for the enrollees’ medical [[Claim Form|claims]] and for all incurred administrative costs. The employer pays a premium that is at a fixed rate for a year based on the number of employees enrolled in the plan.
## Small Employer Group
Insurance companies may group certain industries together and then gather small employers to form a larger group, which enables the insurance company to better predict the cost of insurance.
## Self-Funded [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)]]
The group contracts with the insurance company or third-party administrator to handle the paperwork. This is available to large groups, which pays for the operation of the insurance plan itself and the costs for administration. With this type of plan, the employer pays for each out of pocket claim as it is incurred instead of paying a fixed premium (fully-insured).
## Association Group
This is offered by a different type of group other than an employer, like a credit card company offering insurance benefits to its cardholders.
