# Flexible Spending Account (FSA)
*A tax-advantaged healthcare account an individual contributes money into that is used to pay for certain out-of-pocket healthcare costs.*

An FSA is an account that an individual contributes money into that is used to pay for certain out-of-pocket healthcare costs. It is a tax-advantaged healthcare account available for most employees as no taxes are paid on the money in the account. FSAs are only available with employer-based health plans and can be used to pay for deductibles, copayments, and other medical and dental expenses. The main advantage of an FSA is that it is “pre-tax” dollars, so no federal income tax or social security tax are paid on the amount that is contributed. In some states, state tax is not paid either. By participating, the employee lowers their overall taxable income, so the overall amount of taxes paid is decreased.

Up to $2,700 (2019) may be contributed into an FSA each year, but it requires planning on the part of the employee. For the most part, if the money is not used during the plan year it is forfeited. An employer may offer two options to carry some money over. An employer can provide a grace period of up to 2½ extra months to use the money in the FSA. It can also allow an employee to carry over up to $500 per year to use in the following year. The employer may not offer any options, or one of the two, but not both.

The amount an employee wishes to contribute is deducted from their paycheck in equal amounts each pay period. As the employee incurs healthcare expenses throughout the year, the employee may need to turn in receipts with a form for reimbursement. Some employers have a special debit card that the employee would use, and the money would be taken directly from their account. An FSA is in effect for one plan year. The employee needs to re-enroll each year if they wish to continue to participate. If there are qualifying life events during a plan year (marriage, divorce, birth of a child, etc.), an employee may change their enrollment.
