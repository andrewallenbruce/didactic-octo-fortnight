# Anti-kickback Law
*Knowingly and willfully offering or accepting rewards or remuneration for services that are billable to a federal healthcare plan*

The Anti-Kickback Law (42 United States Code (U.S.C.) Section 1320a-7b(b)) is a federal law that makes it a criminal offense to knowingly or willingly offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce or reward referrals of items or services reimbursable by a federal healthcare program. The Social Security Act of 1972 included the original Anti-kickback legislation. The [[HIPAA | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996]] (See Pub. L. 104-191, 110 Stat. 1936 (1996) increased the scope of [[fraud]] and [[abuse]] sanctions.

The Anti-kickback Law states that any items or service that are received by the physician as payment such as cash or gifts, free rent, expensive trips, or meals can be a violation of the Anti-kickback Law and subject to criminal penalties. The penalties for violation of the Anti-kickback statute are fines of up to $25,000 (before annual inflation adjustment) per violation. This can also carry risk for [[False Claims Act]] liability, civil liability, and prison time. 

One of the most severe penalties associated with the Social Security Act is the ability of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) to exclude an entity or an individual from [[participation]] in any and all federal healthcare programs. This includes [[Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], VA programs, and [[TRICARE]]. An excluded individual cannot bill for services, provide referrals or prescribe medications or order services for any [[beneficiary]] of a federally administered health plan.
