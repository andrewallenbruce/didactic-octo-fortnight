# Medically Unlikely Edits (MUE)
*Part of [[National Correct Coding Initiative | NCCI]] edits that places limits on the frequency that individual codes can be billed on a single date of service by a single provider for a single [[Beneficiary]].*

To help reduce the paid claims error rate for [[Medicare]] Part B claims, [[CMS]] developed Medically Unlikely Edits (MUEs). MUEs define the maximum units of service that a provider would report, under most circumstances, for a single [[beneficiary]], on a single date of service, for a specific [[HCPCS Level II|HCPCS]]/[[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]]速 code. If a code is denied for MUE, the [[Advanced Beneficiary Notice]] is not applicable, and the patient cannot be billed.

## The MUE Table
Below is a portion of the MUE table:

1. HCPCS/CPT速 Code: This indicates the HCPCS Level II code or CPT速 code.
2. Practitioner Services MUE Values: This indicates the number of units that may be billed for the HCPCS Level II code or CPT code.
3. MUE [[Adjudication]] Indicator (MAI): This indicates the type of MUE and its basis. An MAI of 2 indicates an [[edit]] for which the MUE is based on regulation or sub-regulatory instructions (policy), including the instruction that is inherent in the code descriptor or its applicable anatomy. An MAI of 3 indicates an [[edit]] for which the MUE is based on clinical information, such as billing patterns, prescribing instructions, or other information. MAI 3 is the most common per day [[edit]].
4. MUE Rationale: This specifies the [[adjudication]] indicator as to whether it is due to anatomic consideration, nature of service, code descriptor or CPT速 instruction, clinical data, or [[CMS]] policy.
