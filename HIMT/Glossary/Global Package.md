# Global Package
*The period (0–90 days as determined by the health plan) and services provided for a surgery inclusive of preoperative visits, intraoperative services, post-surgical complications not requiring a return trip to the operating room, postoperative visits, post-surgical pain management by the surgeon, and several miscellaneous services as defined by the health plan, regardless of setting (for example, in a hospital, an ambulatory surgical center (ASC), or physician office).*

[[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]] codes describing surgical procedures describe a package of services that may include:
- Local anesthesia (including digital nerve blocks)
- One E/M encounter on the day of, or immediately preceding the date of, surgery (unless the decision for surgery was made at that visit, in which case it may be claimed separately)
- Immediate postoperative care in the recovery area, including writing orders and dictating operative notes
- Talking with the family and other physicians
- Typical postoperative follow-up care

Follow-up services provided during the postoperative global period are typically included in the fee; however, there is no single definition of “global period” for all payers. Medicare designates either a 0-day, 10-day ([[Minor Surgery]]) or 90-day ([[Major Surgery]]) global period for each surgical code. Many payers adopt the Medicare global period.

To determine the global period, the [[Medicare Physician Fee Schedule]] can be referenced:

## Global Days Status Indicators
### 000 
Endoscopies or minor procedures with preoperative and postoperative relative values on the day of the procedure only are reimbursable. Evaluation and management services on the same day of the procedure are generally not payable. (43255, 53020, 67346).
### 010 
Minor procedures with preoperative relative values on the day of the procedure and postoperative relative values during a 10-day postoperative period are reimbursable services. Evaluation and management services on the day of the procedure and during the 10-day postoperative period are also generally not reimbursable. (17261, 40800, 64612).
### 090 
Major procedures with one day preoperative period and 90-days postoperative period are considered to be a component of global package of the major procedure. Evaluation and management services on the day prior to the procedure, the day of the procedure, and during the 90-day postoperative period are not reimbursable. (21048, 32664, 49582).
### MMM
Maternity codes; the usual global period concept does not apply. (59400, 59612).
### XXX
The global concept does not apply to this code. (eg, Evaluation and Management services, Anesthesia, Laboratory and Radiology procedures) (10021, 36593, 38220, 44720).
### YYY
These are unlisted codes, and subject to individual pricing. (19499, 20999, 44979).
### ZZZ
These represent add-on codes. They are related to another service and are always included in the global period of the primary service. (27358, 44955, 67335).
## Follow-up care
Follow-up care for diagnostic procedures includes care related to recovery from the procedure. Care related to the underlying condition for which the diagnostic procedure was performed is not included. Any such care performed during the recovery period may be separately reported. Follow-up care for therapeutic procedures includes those services that are typically included as part of the surgical procedure. Care required due to complications, exacerbations, recurrences, or other diseases may be separately reported. [[Medicare]] will only reimburse separately for postoperative complications that result in a return to the operating room. Postoperative complications treated during an office visit during the postoperative period are included with the global payment and should not be listed separately.
## Multiple Procedures
When multiple procedures are performed during a single surgical episode, the major (or most complex) procedure is reported with the appropriate CPT® code. The additional procedures are reported with [[modifier]] 51 attached to the CPT® codes that describe those additional procedures.
