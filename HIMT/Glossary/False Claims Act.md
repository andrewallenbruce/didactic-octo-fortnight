# False Claims Act
*Federal statute setting criminal and civil penalties for falsely billing the government, over-representing the amount of a delivered product, or under-stating an obligation to the government*

The False Claims Act protects the government from being overcharged or sold substandard goods or services. The False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729–3733) states that any person is liable under the FCA if he or she: 
- (A) Knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval;
- (B) Knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim; 
- (C) Conspires to commit a violation of subparagraph (A), (B), (D), (E), (F), or (G)
- (D) Has possession, custody, or control of property or money used, or to be used, by the government and knowingly delivers, or causes to be delivered, less than all of that money or property; 
- (E) Is authorized to make or deliver a document certifying receipt of property used, or to be used, by the government and, intending to defraud the government, makes or delivers the receipt without completely knowing that the information on the receipt is true; 
- (F) Knowingly buys, or receives as a pledge of an obligation or debt, public property from an officer or employee of the government, or a member of the Armed Forces, who lawfully may not sell or pledge property; or 
- (G) Knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government, or knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government. 

Relative to healthcare services, examples of [[fraud]] or misconduct subject to the False Claims Act include:
- Falsifying a medical chart notation
- Submitting claims for services not performed, not requested, or unnecessary
- Submitting claims for expired drugs
- Upcoding and/or unbundling services
- Submitting claims for physician services performed by a non-physician provider (NPP) without regard to Incident-to guidelines

```ad-Example
title: EXAMPLE False Claims Case
When the primary purpose of the service is the delivery of an evidence physician billed for urine drug screening in the office setting and submitted claims for Medicare patients using low to moderate complexity urine drug tests that exceeded the number of units allowed by [[Medicare]]. The office used an inappropriate code that would bypass the system and allow for reimbursement of a test that would have otherwise been denied. The code reported by the office was for a higher complexity drug screen than was performed. The physician was ordered to repay $334,538.90.

## Reverse False Claims
*Failure to Return [[Overpayment and Recoupment|Overpayments]]*
The final section (a.1.G) is known as the “reverse false claims” section. It provides liability where a person acts improperly to avoid paying money owed to the government. In the FCA (31 USC §3729 (b) (3) (2010)), obligation is defined as “an established duty, whether fixed, arising from an express or implied contractual, grantor-grantee, or licensor-licensee relationship, from a fee-based or similar relationship, from statute or regulation, or from the retention of any [[Overpayment and Recoupment|overpayment]].”

## Deliberate Ignorance of the Truth
The FCA is violated by submitting a false claim with knowledge that it is false; however, the Act states that a violation may occur even if there no intent to defraud. The FCA defines the terms as follows: The terms “knowing” and “knowingly”
- (A) mean that a person, with respect to information—
	- (i) has actual knowledge of the information;
	- (ii) acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information; or
	- (iii) acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information; and
- (B) require no proof of specific intent to defraud.

According to United States legal definitions, deliberate ignorance of the truth means intentionally ignoring a fact when one has every reason to believe about its existence. When knowledge of existence of that fact is an essential part of an offense, such knowledge may be established if the person is aware of a high probability of its existence.

Current penalties are $5,500 to $11,000 (before annual inflation adjustment) per claim. The person in violation will also be liable for the costs of the civil action brought to recover any such penalty or damages. The FCA allows for reduced penalties (mitigation) if the person committing the violation self-discloses and meets other requirements. This amount is occasionally increased based on the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act (FCPIA). CMPs for False Claims Act violations are $11,463 to $22,927 per claim for 2019.
