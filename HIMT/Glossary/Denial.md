# Denial
*Denial of a claim is the refusal of an insurance company or carrier to honor a request by an individual, or his or her provider, to pay for a health care services obtained from a health care professional.*

A true denial, or non-payment of a claim or claim line, is fairly obvious to detect but other payment and revenue opportunities should be monitored in the process as well.

## Underpayment/Overpayment
Inaccurate payment from a difference in contract interpretation, pricing errors or other payment issues.

## Lost Revenue
Can be in the form of undetected payment errors, incomplete or inaccurate billing, services missing from the bill.

## Soft Denial
A temporary or interim denial that has the potential to be paid if the provider takes effective follow up action. Appeal not required.

### Examples
- Pending receipt medical records
- Denied due to missing or inaccurate information
- Coding or charge issues
- Pending itemized bill
- Pending receipt of invoice

## Hard Denial
A denial that results in lost or written off revenue. Appeal is required.

### Examples
- No pre-authorization
- Not a covered service
- Bundling
- Untimely filing

## Preventable or Avoidable Denial
A hard denial resulting from action or inaction on the part of the provider of services.

Usually involve elective services that could have been delayed or deferred
Account for about 90 percent of denials

### Examples
- Registration inaccuracies
- Ineligible for insurance
- Invalid codes
- Medical necessity
- Credentialing

## Clinical Denial
Denials of payment on the basis of medical necessity, length of stay or level of care.

- May be concurrent (while patient is still in house) or retrospective (after the patient is discharged)
- Typically begin as a soft denial
- Delay of payment where further medical or clinical clarification may be required

## Technical or Administrative Denial
A denial in which the payer has notified the provider, by way of remittance advice, with specific information describing why the claim or item was denied.

- Typically done via remark code or reason code
- Includes delay of payment where additional documentation is needed
- Coding clarification
- Requests for medical records
- Itemized bills

## Commonly Misclassified Denials
- **Lack of Coverage**
	- A denial that results when non covered services are provided. Usually the result of insufficient or ineffective insurance verification.
- **Unpreventable**
	- Hard denials resulting from the delivery of emergency services that could not have been delayed.
- **Demand**
	- Claim sent to Medicare specifically for the purpose of obtaining a denial when a patient had signed an ABN.
- **Short Pay**
	- Denials that occurs when a payer incorrectly pays a claim. Invalid case rate, per diem, or fee schedule amount.

# Denials Management

When payers adjudicate (evaluate and determine) a claim, it results in payment or denial notification. When a claim is denied, the billing staff should attempt to resolve the denial by: 
			
- Providing additional information if required by the payer to complete payment processing; 
- Appealing the denial with the payer; or 
- Seeking payment from the patient.

Medical group collections staff are continually challenged by the low-dollar, high-volume nature of the physician revenue stream. Like claim errors, denials will delay the payment process and decrease the effectiveness of the revenue cycle. Keeping denial rates low will reduce the money in accounts receivable (A/R).

Spending time on the phone resolving claim denials is inefficient and is cost effective only for high dollar accounts. The denial notification from the payer will typically indicate the reason for the denial and the next action that is required for claim resolution and payment. This information should be tracked and used to respond to the payer with the requested information. Efficiencies can be found in batching these responses, whenever possible.

A common failure is the lack of effective denials management. Maintaining good control of denials management is best accomplished by regularly reviewing the denial reason codes to determine why the claim was denied and making corrections to prevent similar denials in the future. Run and review a denial reason report, at least monthly. Upon identifying the reasons for the denial, make efforts to review current office processes and eliminate errors that led to the denial. 

## Per MGMA, the six fundamentals to prevent denials are:
1. Educate and communicate
2. Verify Insurance prior to service
3. Know your payers
4.	Document appropriately
5.	Take advantage of technology
6.	Monitor, analyze, revise 

By closely monitoring denials, you can determine errors made by staff and by insurance companies. Running the denial report by payer and denial reason code, will quickly identify patterns of errors or common denials by payer. One of the most financially responsible ways to decrease days in A/R is to implement an improvement effort for denials management processes.

## Tips for preventing denials
1.	Use the 80/20 rule: As a rule of thumb 80 percent of issues are caused by 20 percent of the problems.
2.	Determine actions needed to correct identified problems.
3.	Implement updated policy and educate staff to prevent continued issues with problems identified.
4.	Utilize practice management software rules engine (if available).
5.	Create a culture of zero tolerance for preventable denials.

An example of an effective denials process improvement effort might include the following steps:

This illustration shows an example of an improvement process after a denial reason is identified as a concern. In the top middle box, you see the identification of the denial reason “provider not enrolled.” The next box describes a review of the enrollment process to identify why denials are resulting from the process. It is identified that the provider is not enrolled with some insurances, that there is not a good tool to track the enrollment process, and that the staff involved with scheduling are not aware of what insurances the provider is enrolled with.

The next box describes what is being done to modify the process to reduce these denials including identifying a better tool to track the enrollment process so that providers get fully enrolled and escalating those that are still pending approval. It also includes identifying that correct applications have been sent to each carrier.

The final box includes notifications and training for staff so that they know when a physician is not contracted with a payer. With this information, schedulers can assign patients with these payers to different physicians who are already enrolled.

After making these changes, the denial rates for providers not enrolled will need to be continually monitored. If denials still occur for this reason, additional efforts will need to be made. Otherwise, attention can be placed on a different denial reason with a similar process improvement cycle.

## Explanation of Benefits (EOB) and Remittance Advice (RA)
An explanation of benefits (EOB) is a statement sent by an insurance carrier to the covered individual explaining what medical treatments and/or services were paid for on their behalf. A remittance advice (RA) is a statement sent by an insurance carrier to the medical provider which explains the adjudication decisions on those claims submitted by the provider. An electronic remittance advice (ERA) is an electronic statement sent by an insurance carrier to the medical provider which explains the adjudication decisions on those claims submitted by the provider.

### The RA and ERA include the following information:
- Identifying information for all parties including the patient, medical provider, and insurance carrier
- Claim amounts that include amount charged, amount paid, adjustments applied to the claim, and claim total
- Claim status such as paid, denied, or pending
- Explanation of decision

The EOB sent to the patient will typically have a statement stating it is not a bill.

## Cut Down on Denials With This Handy Primer 
If your practice is spending precious time and money on processing appeals for too many denied claims, it’s time to fix your claims issues upfront. Now is the time to revisit your denial trends and get the pay you deserve. 

To prevent denials in the first place, you’ve got to sift through all of your claims data and analyze the information and your remittance advice (RA), looking for inconsistencies. 

Large-scale organizations may have revenue cycle management (RCM) teams to scrutinize denial data, but even small practices can develop systems and processes that pinpoint problem areas and come up with solutions to cut down on claims issues. 

To uncover the common reasons for your denial troubles, you’ve got to be part Nancy Drew, part number cruncher, and part spreadsheet jockey. 

## Spot Denial Issues with These 6 Steps 

### Here’s the step-by-step process experts recommend. 

1. Start by downloading ERA files from your payers. You can translate ERA files into readable formats using software such as Easy Print, PC Print, vendor applications, or home-grown processes. 
2. Review claim adjustment reason codes (CARCs) to fully understand why the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) or private payer didn’t pay your claim. 
3. Track down the remittance advice remark codes (RARCs) associated with the CARCs. Remember, not all CARCs will have them, but sometimes you’ll see them along with CARCs providing additional information about why the claim was denied. 

Important: The alpha-numeric CARC and RARC themselves won’t tell you much. To get full definitions, remember to go to the website of the Washington Publishing Company (WPC), which manages the codes at http://wpc-edi.com/Reference/. 

Once at the website, you can click on the link for “Claim Adjustment Reason Codes (CARC)” to see the complete list of current codes with their definitions, such as, “6 - The procedure/revenue code is inconsistent with the patient’s age.” You’ll also find a link for “Remittance Advice Remark Codes (RARC),” which provides a complete list of current codes with definitions, such as “N472 Payment for this service has been issued to another provider.” 

Stay up to date: MACs update CARC and RARC three times annually based on WPC’s schedule, typically March 1, July 1, and November 1. That means your practice needs to keep current with the updates if you want to be able to translate your RAs. In addition to the updated list of codes, the website also contains links to deactivated codes, and codes scheduled for deactivation at the next update. 

Step 4: Look for the group code, which describes who has financial responsibility for the charge that’s been denied. 

“CO (Contractual Obligation) assigns responsibility to the provider” while “PR (Patient Responsibility) assigns responsibility to the patient,” according to two examples of financial responsibility outlined by CMS guidance. 

Step 5: Compile your data into a denial trend report that lists reason codes, remark codes, and group codes. Sort your report by reason code so that you can quickly spot denial trends at your organization. 

Step 6: Once you spot denial patterns, you can find the root cause for why they are happening so that you can educate staff or tweak systems. You’ll find your root causes in one or more of these areas: 

- Patient access and registration, including pre-authorizations 
- Clinical encounter and documentation 
- Charge capture/entry 
- CPT® and ICD-10-CM coding 
- Claims preparation and submission 
- Account reconciliation and posting

A thorough review of your denial trends will make it easier to root out your claims errors so that you can take the necessary steps to eradicate them. This may involve staff training, educating clinicians, beefing up your advance beneficiary notice (ABN) procedures, redesigning workflows, reviewing national coverage determinations (NCDs) and local coverage determinations (LCDs), or refining your ICD-10-CM coding to better express medical necessity. 

## Questions and Answers: Denials Management
Question: Our billers are stating they are seeing a lot of denials but are not able to quantify specific denials. Is there a good denial tracking tool that can help us?

Answer: Many practice management systems (PMS) will have the ability to run a denial report. Here is an example of what a denial report may look like. 

You will notice that the name of the denial and the denial code are listed on the left-hand column. The number of denials for the time period are listed next along with the percentage of overall denials and dollar equivalent of the denials. This report will help identify what denials are most prevalent and costing the practice the most money. It will also provide a guide to prioritize the denial management improvement efforts. Here we see that one of the most significant denials that needs to be reviewed is the provider not being enrolled. 

Keep in mind that the denial report will only reflect what is posted in your PMS. If your PMS system has not been set up appropriately, or your payment posters are not posting denials, you may need to track denials manually. You can do that in a simple Microsoft Excel spreadsheet like the one shown below.
