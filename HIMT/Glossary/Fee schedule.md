# Fee schedule
*A list of fees the physician establishes is the fair price for the services they provide.*

A fee schedule is a list of fees physicians established as the fair price for the services they provide. The services listed on a fee schedule will vary depending on the type of medical practice.

For example, a cardiologist’s fee schedule will not be the same as a dermatologist’s fee schedule because each provider performs different services based on their specialties. The service is reported with a [[HCPCS Level II|HCPCS]] Level II or [[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]] code and the fee is attached to the code.

Remember that a fee schedule and a payment schedule are two different types of schedules. The fee schedule is the fee the physician sets as a fair price for the services provided. A payment schedule is what [[Medicare]] or other insurance payers approve as the reimbursement amount for the service provided. For example, a physician may submit a charge of $95 (fee schedule amount) for E/M level 99214, but the payer may only reimburse 99214 at $85 based on its payment schedule. 
## Calculation Methods
There are many methods to calculate a fee schedule. The two most common methods include creating a cost-based fee schedule and creating a fee schedule based on the relative value units ([[Relative Value Unit (RVU)]]) assigned by the Centers for [[Medicare]] & [[Medicaid]] Services ([[CMS]]). 
### Cost-based fee schedule
When determining a cost based-fee schedule, the total costs of each service or procedure the provider will perform must be calculated. These fees are determined by carefully accounting for every cost incurred by the medical practice to provide quality products and services to the patient. 

When calculating the costs, include lease or rental payments; utilities; office supplies and equipment; loan fees; maintenance fees; employee labor; malpractice and/or liability insurance (professional liability insurance purchased by providers to cover the cost of being sued for medical errors resulting in bad patient outcomes that are proven to have been caused by gross negligence or a deviation from the standard of care); health insurance; and other benefit costs. 

Once these costs have been determined, a fee is assigned to the corresponding procedure or service. This is the amount submitted to the payer when the service is rendered.
### RVU-based fee schedule
In 1992, the United States federal government implemented a standardized physician payment schedule utilizing a resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS) which bases payments on the cost of resources needed to provide services. The methodology is comprised of five components:

1. physician work relative value units (work RVU)
2. practice expense relative value units (PE RVU)
3. professional liability insurance relative value units (PLI RVU)
4. geographic practice cost index (GPCI)
5. conversion factor (CF)

A relative value unit is a unit of measure for each medical service that indicates the resources associated with providing a service. 

#### RVU Components
- Physician work component: This represents the relative time and intensity associated with furnishing a [[Medicare Physician Fee Schedule]] (PFS) service and accounts for around 50 percent of the total payment associated with a service.

- Practice expense component: This represents the costs of maintaining a practice (renting office space, purchasing supplies and equipment, staff costs, etc.).

- Professional liability insurance component: This represents the costs of malpractice insurance.

- Geographic practice cost index component: This represents adjustments applied to each of the three relative values above (work, practice, liability) in calculating a physician payment. This is to account for the geographic variations in the costs of practicing medicine in different areas of the country.

- Conversion factor component: This is updated on an annual basis.

#### RBRVS formula
$$\displaystyle \left[ \left( {\text{wRVU}} \times {\text{wGPCI}}\right)+\left( {\text{PE RVU}} \times {\text{PE GPCI}}\right)+\left( {\text{MP RVU}} \times {\text{MP GPCI}}\right)\right] \times {\text{CF}}$$

In determining a fee schedule based on [[Relative Value Unit (RVU)]] ([[CMS]] fee schedule), a medical practice may reference the current Physician Fee Schedule Relative Value Units (PFS RVU) file (http://cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/PhysicianFeeSched/PFS-Relative-Value-Files.html). 

Medical offices then create their own conversion factor and multiply it by the RVUs assigned to each procedure code to create the fee for their individual practice. [[Relative Value Unit (RVU)]] are categorized as either facility or non-facility. The physician’s fee schedule is considered non-facility.

```ad-Example
title: 99214 Example
If the national conversion factor for the 2018 is $35.9996, and the PFS RVU file lists [[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]] code 99214 with a non-facility RVU value of 3.04, the RVUs assigned are multiplied by the conversion factor to calculate the fee.

National fee for 99214: $35.9996 x 3.04 = $109.44

If the office chooses to double the CMS fee for the fee schedule, the conversion factor would be $72.00

Provider fee schedule based on double the CMS fee:

Provider’s fee schedule for 99214: $72.00 x 3.04 = $218.88

This calculation is often rounded to the nearest whole dollar, which would make the fee for 99214 $219.00. 

The calculation can also be done using the fee schedule. 
Take the national fee schedule for 99214 ($109.44) and multiply by 2: $109.44 x 2 = $218.88
Rounded to the nearest dollar, the fee for 99214 would be $219.00.
