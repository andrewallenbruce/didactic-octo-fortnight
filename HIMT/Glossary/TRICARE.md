# TRICARE
*A coverage plan available for military personnel and their families. It is extended to active and retired personnel.*

TRICARE is a healthcare benefit program for military personnel in all seven uniformed branches—the Army, the U.S. Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, the Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the U. S. Public Health Service, and the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It was formerly known as the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services, or CHAMPUS. 

TRICARE is managed in three separate stateside regions, North, South, and West, by separate carriers. Eligibility for TRICARE requires enrollment in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System ([[DEERS]]). 

TRICARE is one of the most confusing plans. Some plans require care to be provided in a military treatment facility and care outside the facility must be approved by the Primary Care Manager. Deductibles and copayments depend on the plan selected and the military status of the patient. Coverage is typically extended to the spouse and unmarried children, but there are restrictions of age and military status at the time of care.

TRICARE utilizes network providers in the same manner as other types of health plans. TRICARE offers coverage choices for health plans: TRICARE Prime®, TRICARE SelectSM, TRICARE for Life, TRICARE Reserve Select®, TRICARE Retired Reserve®, and TRICARE Young Adult.
