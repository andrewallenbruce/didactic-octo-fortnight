# Allowed Amount Reductions
*Medicare allowed and paid amount reductions may occur for a variety of reasons. Below are various conditions that may reduce allowed and paid amounts under the Medicare program. The CMS Internet Only Manual (IOM) location of each reduction is provided with the explanation for each reduction. In the absence of an IOM reference, another published reference is used.*
## Reduction Reasons
### Ambulance Transports (Multiple Patients)
If two patients are transported to same destination simultaneously, for each Medicare beneficiary, Medicare will allow 75 percent of payment allowance for base rate applicable to level of care furnished to that beneficiary plus 50 percent of total mileage payment allowance for entire trip.
  
If three or more patients are transported to same destination simultaneously, payment allowance for Medicare beneficiary (or each of them) is equal to 60 percent of base rate applicable to level of care furnished to beneficiary; however, a single payment allowance for mileage will be prorated by number of patients onboard.

This applies to both ground and air transports.

-   [IOM, Publication 100-04, Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 26, Section10.5](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/clm104c26.pdf)
### Five Year Pricing Limitation
Medicare's claims processing system only holds the pricing/fee schedules for five calendar years. Services processed for dates of service outside of the five-year range will be priced using the oldest year still available.

-   This may affect both the pricing and ability of the claim to process.
-   Services priced manually for a price higher than the fee schedule amount of the oldest available year, will price for the lower rate.
-   Example: A 2009 date of service was adjusted in 2015. Although the code was payable for the year of service, MCS can only use the pricing and status indicators for the oldest available year.
### Global Period/Surgery
Procedures having a global period (0, 10 or 90 days) may be reduced if another service (no global modifier appended) was performed, within global period, and was paid prior to payment of claim containing global procedure itself

-   View more about [Global Surgery](https://med.noridianmedicare.com/web/jeb/specialties/surgery/global-surgery)

Example:
-   90-day global procedure is provided on November 1, 2014
-   Evaluation/Management (E/M) is provided on November 15, 2014
-   E/M is billed first to Medicare and is paid
-   90-day global procedure is billed after E/M is paid
-   90-day global procedure allowed amount may be reduced by allowed amount of E/M
-   Appeal should be requested on E/M to add appropriate modifier, if unrelated to global procedure, as well as appealing payment reduction for 90-day global procedure
