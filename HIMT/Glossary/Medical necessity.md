# Medical necessity
*A decision made by a health plan as to whether a treatment, test, or procedure is necessary for a patient’s health or to treat a diagnosed medical condition.*

Health insurance companies only cover services they define as medically necessary. Medical necessity is defined differently by different entities.

According to § 1862(a)(1)(A) of the [[Social Security Act]], [[Medicare]] will not cover services that “are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member.”

The [[American Medical Association]]’s (AMA) Model [[Managed Care Organization|Managed Care]] Contract contains a definition of medically necessary services as “Healthcare services or procedures that a prudent physician would provide to a patient for the purpose of preventing, diagnosing or treating an illness, injury, disease or its symptoms in a manner that is 
- (a) in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice; 
- (b) clinically appropriate in terms of type, frequency, extent, site and duration; and 
- (c) not primarily for the economic benefit of the health plans and purchasers or for the convenience of the patient, treating physician or other healthcare provider.”

Basically, medical necessity is a decision made by a health plan as to whether a treatment, test, or procedure is necessary for a patient’s health or to treat a diagnosed medical problem. [[Medicare]] releases [[National Coverage Determination]]s (NCDs) and the [[Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC)]]s (MACs) release [[Local Coverage Determination]]s (LCDs) to state whether an item or service will be considered medically necessary. The [[National Correct Coding Initiative]] (NCCI) is released by the [[CMS|Centers for Medicare & Medicaid]] Services (CMS) to indicate codes considered to be bundled for procedures and services deemed necessary to accomplish a [[Major Surgery|major]] procedure. [[Medically Unlikely Edits]] (MUEs) are released by [[CMS]] to indicate the number of units that can be reported for a service or procedure on the same day.
