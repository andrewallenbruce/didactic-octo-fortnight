# Accounts Receivable
*Money owed to the practice for services rendered and billed.* 

A/R is the total charges entered that have not been collected. It identifies charges that have been submitted to an insurance payer or patient but have not been paid. The A/R balance can be reduced by receiving payments or by entering contractual or [[write-off]] adjustments. Claims become more difficult and costlier to collect the older they become.

The accounts receivable department manages the amounts owed to a facility by patients who received services but whose payments will be made at a later date by the patients or guarantors or their third-party payers. After the claim is submitted to a TPP for reimbursement, the time allowed to remit a payment to accounts receivable begins. Typical performance statistics maintained by the accounts receivable department include days in AR and aging of accounts. Days in AR is calculated by dividing the ending AR balance for a given period by the average revenue per day. Facilities typically set performance goals for this standard.

## Aging
Aging of accounts is maintained in 30-day increments (0 - 30, 31 - 60, and so forth.) Facilities monitor the number of accounts and the total dollar value in each increment. The older the account or the longer the account remains unpaid, the less likely the facility will receive reimbursement for the encounter.

Most claims are originally billed to insurance, and until the insurance makes a payment, the responsibility for the payment continues to be with the insurance carrier. After the insurance carrier makes or denies a payment (and there is no just cause for an appeal), the responsibility for the balance of the account will switch to either the physician (to be written off) or to the patient (to be sent an invoice.)

Aging categorizes A/R according to the length of time charges have been outstanding as well as the responsible parties. These time periods are commonly 0 - 30 days, 31 - 60 days, 61 - 90 days, 91 - 120 days, and 121+ days. Aging is usually represented as a dollar amount and a percentage.

## Claims Reconciliation and Collections
The last component of the revenue cycle is claims reconciliation and collections. The healthcare facility uses the EOB, MSN, and RA to reconcile accounts. In this process the facility compares expected reimbursement to the actual reimbursement provided by the TPP and patient. EOBs and MSNs identify the amount owed by the patient to the facility. Collections can contact the patient to collect outstanding deductibles and copayments. RAs indicate rejected or denied line items or whole claims. Facilities can review the RAs and determine whether the claim can be corrected and resubmitted for additional payment. If a correction is not warranted, reconciliation can be made via write-off or adjustment to the patient’s account. After the account has been settled, the revenue cycle is complete.

## A/R Management
Accounts receivable (A/R) represents money owed to the healthcare practice by patients and/or insurance carriers. The accounts receivable cycle begins with the delivery of service and continues until payment for the service is reconciled to a zero balance.

Accounts receivable management is a system that assists providers in the collection of the reimbursement for services rendered. The functions of accounts receivable management include insurance verification, insurance eligibility, [[prior authorization]], billing and claims submission, posting payments, and collections.

## [[1. Introduction|Days in A/R]]
The success of a practice’s billing operations is often measured in A/R days. The A/R balance can be reduced by receiving payments or by entering contractual or [[Write-Off|write off]] [[Adjustments]]. It is important to manage the A/R balance as claims become much more difficult to collect the older they become. Good management of the A/R is also imperative to maintaining a good cash flow for the business. A poor A/R process can result in loss of money to the business and result in financial strains to the owners. If all these tasks are being done properly, the [[1. Introduction|days in A/R]] number should be low, in contrast, high days in A/R number will most likely tell you there is a problem in your revenue cycle.

### Formula
[[1. Introduction|Days in A/R]] is a fraction. The numerator is the total A/R. The denominator is average daily charges. Average daily charges are calculated by taking the total charges over the last 2 months (can also be one month) and dividing by the total number of days in those two (or one) months.

==Example==:

==Total A/R== = $200,000

==Average Daily Charge== = $4,250

==Days in A/R== = \$200,000/$4,250 = 47.06 days in A/R

## Steps to Working the Account Receivables
Efficient accounts receivable management is crucial to the financial viability of a medical practice. Steps to help reduce the accounts receivable include:

### Financial policy
A practice must have a financial policy that is conveyed to every patient. The policy should be posted at the front desk, a copy should be given to every new patient, and the front office should clearly communicate the policy to patients. The financial policy should explain the total expected cost of the visit and convey that copayments, co-insurance, and/or deductibles are required at the time of service. The policy should also detail the insurance plans that are accepted, and the practice’s policy for out-of-network insurance policies.

### Verify insurance
The patient’s insurance should be verified every time a patient is seen. The patient may present an insurance card but that does not mean they are insured. Coverage changes are common. A patient may change insurance plans, identification numbers may change, or the copayments and deductibles may change. Prior to treatment, the insurance carrier should
be contacted to confirm coverage and the amount to be collected from the patient. This can be done through phone calls, the insurance carrier’s website, or through the clearinghouse.

### Registration Process
The patient registration process is one of the most important jobs when it comes to account receivables. Accurate information must be obtained
initially to avoid costly errors later. Claims can be denied by the insurance carrier if the correct information is not collected. A patient statement cannot be paid if it isn’t delivered to the patient. An incorrect address can result in postal returns. Ask the patient the information in the correct way. Do not ask “has your information changed?” Instead the front desk staff should ask the patient “what is your address, phone, employment, and insurance information.” Have the patient give answers to open ended questions instead of a yes or no confirmation.

### Collections
Copayments should be collected by the front desk at registration. It is more difficult to collect payment after the patient has received treatment. Many times, patients will leave the office without paying or state they forgot their checkbook or debit card at home. When this happens, the practice has the added cost of sending a statement to the patient to collect the money that should have been collected up front. The routine
waiver of copayments can also open the practice up to liability. Many contracts also require the collection of copayments. Make it easy for patients to pay by offering multiple payment options such as accepting cash, checks, and credit or debit cards.

### Submit Claims Correctly
Health insurance claims are most often rejected due to inaccurate or missing information. A claim denied by the health insurance company can result in adding a few weeks to the A/R days because the patient’s information must be pulled, verified, and corrected in the [[practice management system]] before the claim is resubmitted.

### Monitor
After an insurance carrier processes a claim, an RA or ERA is sent to the provider with payments from the insurance carriers. This should be posted immediately upon receipt. Payments should be monitored to assure that the claims are being processed and paid appropriately. It is also important to monitor that the payments are posted correctly including the amount adjusted and billed to the secondary carrier or the patient.

### Denials
Denials or reimbursement problems should be worked as soon as they are received from the insurance carriers. Each denied claim should be reviewed to determine whether additional information is needed, if errors need to be corrected, or if the denial should be appealed. These denials will be identified when posting the payments, reviewing remittance advice, and on aging reports.

### Patient Statements/Invoices
Patient statements should be sent as the remittance advice has been posted. The sooner the statement is received by the patient, the sooner it is likely to be paid. Patient statements should detail the date of service, services performed, insurance reimbursement received, payments collected at the time of service, and reason the patient balance is due.

### [[Write-Off|Write-offs]]
The financial policy should address the handling of past due accounts. A practice may automatically [[Write-Off|write off]] small patient balances for which processing costs exceed potential collections.
