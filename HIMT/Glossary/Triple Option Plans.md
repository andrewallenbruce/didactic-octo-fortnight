# Triple Option Plans
*Allows an insurer to administer three different healthcare plans so that members may select the benefit options they want: straight indemnity insurance, an [[Health Maintenance Organization|HMO]], or a [[Preferred Provider Organization|PPO]].*

A triple option plan is usually operated by a single insurance plan or a joint venture among two or more insurance payers. A triple option plan allows an insurer to administer three different healthcare plans so that members may select the benefit options they want: straight indemnity insurance, an [[Health Maintenance Organization|HMO]], or a [[Preferred Provider Organization|PPO]]. 

An indemnity plan allows the patient to choose any physician and facility of their choosing. The health plan then pays a set portion, such as 80 percent, of the total charges. 

Many plans utilize usual, customary, and reasonable rates, or UCR rates, to base the reimbursement percentage for payment. A UCR rate is stated to be the amount that providers in the area where the services were rendered typically charge for the same service. 

These plans are also referred to as fee-for-service plans. A triple option plan allows the member to choose the option that is best for them. 

The indemnity plan is costlier but gives the patient the most choices of providers and facilities. 

The [[Preferred Provider Organization|PPO]] is in the middle, as it is more restrictive, but less costly than an indemnity policy, and less restrictive, but costlier, than an [[Health Maintenance Organization|HMO]]. 

The [[Health Maintenance Organization|HMO]] is the most restrictive, and least costly of all the plans.
