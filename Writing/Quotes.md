>“If we’ve done well in life, we have fellow travelers to thank. No one succeeds alone. In my life’s story, many of the heroes are teachers. Several extraordinary educators from elementary school through graduate school invited me into a world of never-ending wonder and gave me the confidence to make it my own. More than the content of their lessons, what influenced me most were the ways they found to connect with me as a person who was worthy of their time. Their remarkable kindness, commitment to education, and practiced skill helped me become the person, and the teacher, that I am today. If I’ve done and can continue to do for others what these teachers have done for me, my life has meaning.“- **Stephen Few**

>”I distinguish four types. There are clever, hardworking, stupid, and lazy officers. Usually two characteristics are combined. Some are clever and hardworking; their place is the General Staff. The next ones are stupid and lazy; they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the mental clarity and strength of nerve necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is both stupid and hardworking; he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always only cause damage.“- [**Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_von_Hammerstein-Equord?cmdid=W4ZTAGYM2SDEI9)
