## Keep your resume format concise

There’s no “best” format for a resume. Instead, think about what you want to highlight about yourself to potential employers. 

For instance, if you have relevant work experience, then pick a format to highlight that. 

If you are transitioning from a different career and don’t yet have relevant work experience, then you may want to pick a format that highlights your technical skills and portfolio projects. Some resume formats include a **Summary** or **Goals** section at the top to help candidates add context to their application, while other resume formats avoid these sections completely and save that space for sections such as **Skills** and **Experience**.  

Whatever format you pick, make sure to follow the one-page rule and keep the completed version on just a single page. If the one-page rule seems limiting, think about the purpose resumes serve in the hiring process overall. Resumes are short documents designed to communicate the most pertinent information about yourself to recruiters and hiring managers at a glance. These are different from longer, multi-page Curriculum Vitaes (CVs) that exhaustively list every relevant thing the candidate has ever done. 

If an employer wants a detailed history of your past work experiences and accolades, they might specifically request a CV (curriculum vitae) instead. If they don’t, always assume they prefer a resume. While it is generally considered acceptable for resumes of applicants with extensive work history applying for senior technical roles to have two-page resumes, these are the exception rather than the rule. When applying for a data analyst position, keep it to one page!

Once you decide on a template, resist the urge to begin filling it out. The next lessons will focus on best practices for communicating your skills and experience in meaningful, impactful ways. Keep this resume template handy, as you’ll be working on it further.

## Add skills to your resume

Data analysts are expected to have strong technical skills and abilities, so effectively highlighting those skills is a crucial part of crafting your resume. Focus on your skills for this activity. Don’t worry about adding your work experience just yet; you’ll complete that in a future activity.

### Get help from the real world

Reviewing real-world resumes is always a great idea. It can help you get a feel for how others in the industry are representing their experience and skills. You can find resumes on job sites and LinkedIn or even just by searching for “data analyst resume.”  There are many ways to represent your technical skills, and taking a moment to understand how other data analysts do this may give you some great ideas! 

### What skills to add

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/eBTZXBOlTKyU2VwTpaysSg_20d43cf528ca44b691c2ed76d2d1ac49_image1.png?expiry=1628726400000&hmac=0Honws4vYzsBqqkMDUahtlUvIJ1eqrTLce3QMJxJesA)

The skills section on your resume likely only has room for 2-4 bullet points, so be sure to use this space effectively. You might want to prioritize technical skills over soft skills. This is a great chance for you to highlight some of the skills you’ve picked up in these courses, such as:

-   Strong analytical skills
-   Pattern recognition
-   Relational databases and SQL
-   Strong data visualization skills
-   Proficiency with spreadsheets, SQL, R, and Tableau

Notice how the skills listed above communicate a well-rounded data analyst’s skill set without being wordy. The skills section summarizes what you’re capable of doing while listing the technology and tools you are proficient in.

Many companies use algorithms to screen and filter resumes for keywords. If your resume does not contain the keywords they are searching for, a human may never even read your resume. Reserving at least one bullet point to list specific programs you are familiar with is a great way to make sure your resume makes it past automated keyword screenings and onto the desk of a recruiter or hiring manager.

Take a moment to complete the skills section of your resume.

## Adding experience to a resume
### Best practices for writing about experience

One of the most important functions of a resume is communicating your prior work experience in a favorable light. This can often be challenging, as the one-page format forces job seekers to summarize all of their work experience into a few bullet points. 

Resume best practices will help you select the most relevant parts of your work experience and communicate them in the shortest, most impactful way possible. 

As you think about how to represent your work experience on your resume effectively, it might be helpful to refer to these best practices:

Focus on your accomplishments first, and explain them using the formula **“Accomplished X, as measured by Y, by doing Z.”** 

-   These statements help you communicate the most important things a recruiter or hiring manager is searching for—the impact of your work.
-   Whenever possible, use numbers to explain your accomplishments. For example, “Increased manufacturing productivity by 15% by improving shop floor employee engagement,” is better than “Increased manufacturing productivity.”

Phrase your work experience and duties using **Problem-Action-Result** (PAR) statements. 

-   For example, instead of saying “was responsible for two blogs a month,” phrase it as “earned little-known website over 2,000 new clicks through strategic blogging.” 

Describe jobs that highlight **transferable skills** (those skills that can transfer from one job or industry to another). 

-   This is especially important if you are transitioning from another industry into data analytics. 
-   For example, communication is a skill often used in job descriptions for data analysts, so highlight examples from your work experience that demonstrate your ability to communicate effectively.

Describe jobs that highlight your **soft skills**.

-   These are non-technical traits and behaviors that relate to how you work.
-    Are you detail-oriented? Do you have grit and perseverance? Are you a strong critical thinker? Do you have leadership skills? 
-   For instance, you could give an example of when you demonstrated leadership on the job.
-   Showing is always more effective than telling. 

This is almost always the hardest part of crafting a resume, especially if you are transitioning from a different career field. However, if you take a moment to think deeply about your previous work experience, you’ll likely discover that you can find ways to represent your work experiences in a way that highlights your ability to do things important to data analyst roles, such as thinking critically or making data-driven decisions.

### Get the interview first

Remember that the goal of a resume is to get you an interview. You may find that you need to brainstorm and carefully edit your resume to effectively summarize your background. In the end, you will have all of your various responsibilities and accomplishments from previous jobs synthesized into a few bullet points. That way, your resume will highlight what potential employers like to know about applicants.

Effective resumes communicate that you are a candidate who understands the needs of the role and you have the skills and experience to warrant an interview. During interviews, you can expect questions about your experience and that’s when you can go into more detail.

## Add your work experience

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/uRlUyqTwS1GZVMqk8KtRew_a492f67f207a45419a77e2f30c52cac5_image2.png?expiry=1628726400000&hmac=GvUECCCkJ9e_LlF-KA0MPG30noeEcZoeAhP7KgGBf38)

Now that you have had some time to think about your work experience, add it to your resume. Keep in mind the best practices we shared above and that creating a resume is a process. You’ll likely come back to work on it multiple times and change phrasing or formatting. With effort and time, you’ll eventually get your resume to a place where you’re satisfied with the final result. 

### Sample experience description

Earlier, you downloaded a template of bullet points describing work experience. Refer to this as you write about your own work experience. Notice how it demonstrates factual, measurable successes and job experience that is applicable to the role of a data analyst in a short, concise manner.

If you need inspiration or want to see how other data analysts have structured their resumes, take a moment to search for resumes of real data analysts. You can find these easily on sites such as LinkedIn. Seeing how other data analysts have structured and worded their own resumes may give you valuable insight about more effective ways to highlight your own experience.
