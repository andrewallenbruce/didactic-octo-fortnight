[Hi, let's get into it. 

Motivational speaker Wayne Dyer once said, 

"If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change." 

This is so true in data analytics. 

No two analytics projects are ever exactly the same. 

So it only makes sense that different projects require us 

to focus on different information differently.

In this video, 

we'll explore different methods that data analysts use to look at data differently 

and how that leads to more efficient and effective data cleaning.

Play video starting at ::36 and follow transcript0:36

Some of these methods include sorting and filtering pivot tables, 

a function called VLOOKUP, and plotting to find outliers.

Play video starting at ::47 and follow transcript0:47

Let's start with sorting and filtering. 

As you learned earlier, sorting and 

filtering data helps data analysts customize and 

organize the information the way they need for a particular project. 

But these tools are also very useful for data cleaning.

Play video starting at :1:3 and follow transcript1:03

You might remember that sorting involves arranging data into a meaningful 

order to make it easier to understand, analyze, and visualize.

Play video starting at :1:13 and follow transcript1:13

For data cleaning, 

you can use sorting to put things in alphabetical or numerical order, 

so you can easily find a piece of data.

Play video starting at :1:22 and follow transcript1:22

Sorting can also bring duplicate entries closer together for faster identification.

Play video starting at :1:29 and follow transcript1:29

Filters, on the other hand, are very useful in data cleaning when you want to 

find a particular piece of information.

Play video starting at :1:36 and follow transcript1:36

You learned earlier that filtering means showing only the data that meets 

a specific criteria while hiding the rest.

Play video starting at :1:44 and follow transcript1:44

This lets you view only the information you need.

Play video starting at :1:48 and follow transcript1:48

When cleaning data, you might use a filter to only find values 

above a certain number, or just even or odd values. 

Again, this helps you find what you need quickly and 

separates out the information you want from the rest.

Play video starting at :2:5 and follow transcript2:05

That way you can be more efficient when cleaning your data.

Play video starting at :2:10 and follow transcript2:10

Another way to change the way you view data is by using pivot tables.

Play video starting at :2:15 and follow transcript2:15

You've learned that a pivot table is a data summarization tool that is used in 

data processing.

Play video starting at :2:21 and follow transcript2:21

Pivot tables sort, reorganize, group, count, total or average data stored in the database. 

In data cleaning, pivot tables are used to give you a quick, clutter- 

free view of your data. You can choose to look at the specific parts 

of the data set that you need to get a visual in the form of a pivot table.

Play video starting at :2:44 and follow transcript2:44

Let's create one now using our cosmetic makers spreadsheet again.

Play video starting at :2:49 and follow transcript2:49

To start, select the data we want to use. 

Here, we'll choose the entire spreadsheet. Select "Data" and then "Pivot table."

Play video starting at :3:5 and follow transcript3:05

Choose "New sheet" and "Create."

Play video starting at :3:11 and follow transcript3:11

Let's say we're working on a project that requires us 

to look at only the most profitable products. 

Items that earn the cosmetics maker at least $10,000 in orders. 

So the row we'll include is "Total" for total profits.

Play video starting at :3:31 and follow transcript3:31

We'll sort in descending order to put the most profitable items at the top.

Play video starting at :3:38 and follow transcript3:38

And we'll show totals.

Play video starting at :3:41 and follow transcript3:41

Next, we'll add another row for products

Play video starting at :3:49 and follow transcript3:49

so that we know what those numbers are about. 

We can clearly determine tha the most profitable products 

have the product codes 15143 E-X-F-O and 32729 

M-A-S-C.

Play video starting at :4:6 and follow transcript4:06

We can ignore the rest for 

this particular project because they fall below $10,000 in orders.

Play video starting at :4:17 and follow transcript4:17

Now, we might be able to use context clues to assume we're talking 

about exfoliants and mascaras. 

But we don't know which ones, or if that assumption is even correct.

Play video starting at :4:30 and follow transcript4:30

So we need to confirm what the product codes correspond to.

Play video starting at :4:34 and follow transcript4:34

And this brings us to the next tool. 

It's called VLOOKUP.

Play video starting at :4:39 and follow transcript4:39

VLOOKUP stands for vertical lookup. 

It's a function that searches for 

a certain value in a column to return a corresponding piece of information. 

When data analysts look up information for a project, it's rare for 

all of the data they need to be in the same place. 

Usually, you'll have to search across multiple sheets or 

even different databases.

Play video starting at :5:5 and follow transcript5:05

The syntax of the VLOOKUP is equals VLOOKUP, open parenthesis, 

then the data you want to look up. 

Next is a comma and where you want to look for that data.

Play video starting at :5:19 and follow transcript5:19

In our example, this will be the name of a spreadsheet followed by an exclamation point.

Play video starting at :5:25 and follow transcript5:25

The exclamation point indicates that we're referencing a cell in a different 

sheet from the one we're currently working in.

Play video starting at :5:32 and follow transcript5:32

Again, that's very common in data analytics.

Play video starting at :5:35 and follow transcript5:35

Okay, next is the range in the place where you're looking for 

data, indicated using the first and last cell separated by a colon. 

After one more comma is the column in the range containing the value to return.

Play video starting at :5:50 and follow transcript5:50

Next, another comma and the word "false," 

which means that an exact match is what we're looking for.

Play video starting at :5:59 and follow transcript5:59

Finally, complete your function by closing the parentheses. 

To put it simply, VLOOKUP searches for the value in the first argument in 

the leftmost column of the specified location.

Play video starting at :6:12 and follow transcript6:12

Then the value of the third argument tells VLOOKUP to 

return the value in the same row from the specified column.

Play video starting at :6:20 and follow transcript6:20

The "false" tells VLOOKUP that we want an exact match.

Play video starting at :6:25 and follow transcript6:25

Soon you'll learn the difference between exact and approximate matches. 

But for now, just know that V lookup takes the value in one cell and 

searches for a match in another place.

Play video starting at :6:38 and follow transcript6:38

Let's begin.

Play video starting at :6:41 and follow transcript6:41

We'll type equals VLOOKUP.

Play video starting at :6:49 and follow transcript6:49

Then add the data we are looking for, which is the product data.

Play video starting at :6:56 and follow transcript6:56

The dollar sign makes sure that the corresponding part of the reference 

remains unchanged.

Play video starting at :7:3 and follow transcript7:03

You can lock just the column, just 

the row, or both at the same time.

Play video starting at :7:19 and follow transcript7:19

Next, we'll tell it to look at Sheet 2, in both columns

Play video starting at :7:33 and follow transcript7:33

We added 2 to represent the second column.

Play video starting at :7:37 and follow transcript7:37

The last term, "false," says we wanted an exact match.

Play video starting at :7:47 and follow transcript7:47

With this information, we can now analyze the data for 

only the most profitable products.

Play video starting at :8:1 and follow transcript8:01

Going back to the two most profitable products, we can search for 

15143 E-X-F-O And 32729 M-A-S-C. 

Go to Edit and then Find. Type 

in the product codes and 

search for them.

Play video starting at :8:31 and follow transcript8:31

Now we can learn which products we'll be using for this particular project.

Play video starting at :8:36 and follow transcript8:36

The final tool we'll talk about is something called plotting. 

When you plot data, you put it in a graph chart, table, or 

other visual to help you quickly find what it looks like.

Play video starting at :8:49 and follow transcript8:49

Plotting is very useful when trying to identify any skewed data or outliers. 

For example, if we want to make sure the price of each product is correct, 

we could create a chart. This would give us a visual aid that helps 

us quickly figure out if anything looks like an error.

Play video starting at :9:10 and follow transcript9:10

So let's select the column with our prices.

Play video starting at :9:15 and follow transcript9:15

Then we'll go to Insert and choose Chart.

Play video starting at :9:24 and follow transcript9:24

Pick a column chart as the type. One of these prices looks extremely low.

Play video starting at :9:31 and follow transcript9:31

If we look into it, 

we discover that this item has a decimal point in the wrong place.

Play video starting at :9:41 and follow transcript9:41

It should be $7.30, not 73 cents.

Play video starting at :9:51 and follow transcript9:51

That would have a big impact on our total profits. 

So it's a good thing we caught that during data cleaning.

Play video starting at :9:58 and follow transcript9:58

Looking at data in new and 

creative ways helps data analysts identify all kinds of dirty data.

Play video starting at :10:5 and follow transcript10:05

Coming up, you'll continue practicing these new concepts so 

you can get more comfortable with them. 

You'll also learn additional strategies for ensuring your data is clean, 

and we'll provide you with effective insights. 

Great work so far.](<Hi, let's get into it. Motivational speaker Wayne Dyer once said, "If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change." This is so true in data analytics.
