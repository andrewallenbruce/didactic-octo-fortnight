Now that you have practiced writing SQL functions, you can pause for a moment and think about what you are learning. In this self-reflection, you will consider your thoughts about your experience with learning SQL and respond to brief questions. 

This self-reflection will help you develop insights into your own learning and prepare you to identify your successes and difficulties with learning SQL so you can understand how to develop your skills further. As you answer questions—and come up with questions of your own—you will consider concepts, practices, and principles to help refine your understanding and reinforce your learning. You’ve done the hard work, so make sure to get the most out of it: This reflection will help your knowledge stick!

## Your SQL experience (so far)

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/yXcb7sM7QGO3G-7DO5BjSw_2ce2d27eda914feb99d091be0d2459d8_image4.png?expiry=1628640000000&hmac=8lewmnLGZoTgMRkbxvfY3pJqi1la-gegD1VzTu1kA1c)

So far, you have been introduced to many different tools available in SQL. As a brief review, you learned how to complete tasks such as:

-   Getting data from a table using **SELECT** statements.
-   De-duplicating data using commands like **DISTINCT** and **COUNT +** **WHERE**.
-   Manipulating string data with **TRIM(), SUBSTR,** and **LENGTH**.
-   Creating/dropping tables with **CREATE TABLE** and **DROP TABLE**.
-   Changing data types with **CAST**.

Some of these tasks are more challenging than others, and learning all the various SQL functions takes work. But, when you practice different functions, you can master the skills needed to make SQL work the way you need it to. Take a moment to think about the parts of SQL that you’ve found most challenging.
