Now that you have learned about how to prepare for data cleaning, you can pause for a moment and reflect on these steps. In this self-reflection, you will consider your thoughts about the importance of pre-cleaning activities and respond to brief questions. 

This self-reflection will help you develop insights into your own learning and prepare you to apply your knowledge of pre-cleaning activities and insufficient data to your own data cleaning work. As you answer questions—and come up with questions of your own—you will consider concepts, practices, and principles to help refine your understanding and reinforce your learning. You’ve done the hard work, so make sure to get the most out of it: This reflection will help your knowledge stick!

## Review data integrity

Before data analysts can analyze data, they first need to think about and understand the data they're working with. Assessing data integrity is a key step in this process. As you've learned in previous lessons, you should complete the following tasks before analyzing data: 

1. Determine data integrity by assessing the overall accuracy, consistency, and completeness of the data.

2. Connect objectives to data by understanding how your business objectives can be served by an investigation into the data.

3. Know when to stop collecting data.

Data analysts perform pre-cleaning activities to complete these steps. Pre-cleaning activities help you determine and maintain **data integrity,** which is essential to the role of a junior data analyst.

## What makes data insufficient

One of the objectives of pre-cleaning activities is to address #insufficient_data. Recall from previous lessons that data can be insufficient for a number of reasons. Insufficient data has one or more of the following problems:

-   Comes from only one source
-   Continuously updates and is incomplete
-   Is outdated
-   Is geographically limited

To deal with insufficient data, you can:

-   Identify trends within the available data
-   Wait for more data if time allows
-   Discuss with stakeholders and adjust your objective
-   Search for a new dataset
