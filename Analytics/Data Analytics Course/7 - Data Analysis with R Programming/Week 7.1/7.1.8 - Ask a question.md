Now that you have been introduced to the programming language R, you can pause for a moment and consider what to do when you encounter a problem. In this self-reflection, you will consider your thoughts about asking for help online and respond to brief questions. 

This self-reflection will help you develop insights into your own learning and prepare you to apply your participation in online data communities to your experience learning R. As you answer questions—and come up with questions of your own—you will consider concepts, practices, and principles to help refine your understanding and reinforce your learning. You’ve done the hard work, so make sure to get the most out of it: This reflection will help your knowledge stick!

## Use Kaggle to ask a question

One of the most helpful resources for learning R is the large online community of fellow data analysts. R programmers all over the world assist one another on online forums to discuss and solve syntax questions and data problems. 

Coming up, you’ll ask your peers for help with R. Specifically, you’ll go to [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/), which you may remember from when you learned about data types and structures in Course 3.

Once you’re there, you will **write a post on the forum** asking a question about R. Whether it’s a question about learning strategies or R syntax, someone on Kaggle should be able to help. Remember to use the search function to check if your question has already been answered—you save time for everyone when you avoid duplicate questions.
