Annotations are a useful way to add notes to your plot. They help you explain the plot’s purpose, highlight important data points, or comment on any data trends or findings the plot illustrates. You have already learned how to add notes as labels, titles, subtitles, and captions. You can also draw arrows or add shapes to your plot to create more emphasis. Usually you add these kinds of annotations in your presentation application after you have saved the visualizations. But, you can now add lines, arrows, and shapes to your plots using **ggplot2**.
