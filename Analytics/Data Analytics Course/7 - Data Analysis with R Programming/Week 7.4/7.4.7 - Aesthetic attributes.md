In this reading, you will learn about the three basic aesthetic attributes to consider when creating ggplot2 visualizations in R: **color, size,** and **shape.** These attributes are essential tools for creating data visualizations with ggplot2 and are built directly into its code.

## Aesthetics in ggplot2

**Ggplot2** is an R package that allows you to create different types of data visualizations right in your R workspace. In ggplot2, an **aesthetic** is defined as a visual property of an object in your plot. 

There are three aesthetic attributes in ggplot2:

-   **Color**: this allows you to change the color of all of the points on your plot, or the color of each data group
-   **Size**: this allows you to change the size of the points on your plot by data group
-   **Shape**: this allows you to change the shape of the points on your plot by data group

Here’s an example of how aesthetic attributes are displayed in R:

``ggplot(data, aes(x=distance, y= dep_delay, color=carrier, size=air_time, shape = carrier)) +``

`` geom_point()``

By applying these aesthetic attributes to your work with ggplot2, you can create data visualizations in R that clearly communicate trends in your data.
