Earlier in this course, you learned about what to put in an effective data analyst portfolio. In this activity, you will add your portfolio content to a Kaggle notebook.

As you create your data analytics portfolio, you might find yourself using Kaggle or another online platform to host it. Kaggle hosts interactive notebooks that let you showcase your programming and hard work. If you have an existing portfolio already, you can copy your content into Kaggle to have an additional way to share it.

By the time you complete this activity, you will have created a Kaggle notebook containing your portfolio content. Then you can easily share your work with a Kaggle link, enabling you to send your portfolio to more people.

## Types of notebooks

First, it’s helpful to know the different kinds of Notebooks on Kaggle. Every kind of Kaggle Notebook utilizes code, but each one contains different languages for programming or writing text. The different types include: 

-   Scripts: Typically code-only documents. Cells can be formatted in R or Python only. They execute each cell as code sequentially. 
-   RMarkdown scripts: Cells can be formatted in R and RMarkdown only. These files are preferred by many R authors.
-   Jupyter Notebooks: Cells can be formatted in Markdown, R, or Python. These are most suited to flexibility.

Before you create a Notebook in Kaggle, you should know which kind of Notebook you intend to use. Will you use any Markdown or RMarkdown to add context to your work? Will you be using R or Python? The answer to these questions will determine which Notebook you use.

To share the code you wrote in this course, you should choose a Kaggle Notebook that supports R and Markdown, such as an R Markdown script or a Jupyter Notebook.

## Add R to your notebook

1. To begin, log in to Kaggle and go to [Kaggle.com/code](https://www.kaggle.com/code).

2. Click **+ New Notebook** to create a new notebook. If you want to use an existing notebook, go to the **Your work** tab and scroll to the notebook you want to use.

3. Decide whether you want to use a type of script or a Jupyter notebook, based on your project’s needs. The editor will begin on default as a notebook. If you want to change your notebook to a script, click on **File** at the top of your editor and hover over **Editor Type**. This opens a drop-down menu to select **Notebook** or **Script**. For this activity, select **Notebook**.

4. Since the work you did in the last course was in R instead of Python, you need to change the notebook’s language. Click on **File** at the top of your editor and hover over **Language**. This opens a dropdown menu with both options available. Select **R** if it isn’t selected already.

5. Open the file of a project you want to use in your portfolio. This can be the capstone project you completed during this course, an earlier activity you completed in a past course, or a personal project you created. Ideally, this project should demonstrate your coding ability and your data analytics knowledge. 

6. Add the content of your portfolio piece. Copy the code you wrote into R cells and copy regular text or images into Markdown cells. To add a cell to the document, click **+ Code** or **+ Markdown**. It helps to test your code in the Kaggle interface by running it periodically as you write or copy it in. This way, you ensure that it doesn’t return an error.

7. Repeat steps 2-6 to upload your portfolio pieces to their own Kaggle notebooks. You have now created (or duplicated) your portfolio in Kaggle! Your next step is to publish your portfolio so it can be publicly available for others to view and provide feedback.

## Publish your portfolio

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/TOqxzuNFR2eqsc7jRVdnKg_a3c6611d874f403a923e10406b4f38a9_image4.png?expiry=1629849600000&hmac=oLwxuQZs1zjUK2s9K6aNhkkZkPKN0A8uau-e6DpR4ks)

Now, it’s time to publicly publish your portfolio on Kaggle. This will allow peers, hiring managers, and potential employers to view your skill set.

-   **Note:** When you publish your portfolio, you will also need to publicize all documents associated with it. For example, if you include a link to a document on Google Drive, you will need to ensure it is also publicly viewable.

1. To begin, navigate to the **Your work** tab on the **Code** screen to bring you to the list of your notebooks and scripts.

2. Click on the first notebook or script you’d like to publicize. At the top right-hand corner, click the **Share** button with the **Lock** icon.

3. If the pop-up window states that the document is private, click on the word **Private**. This will open a drop-down menu where you will be able to select **Public**. Once it is Public, you’ll be able to add any relevant tags or collaborators who contributed to the document. You can use tags to describe the topics your work relates to. [Click here](https://www.kaggle.com/tags) to learn more about which tags you can use on Kaggle.

4. Repeat these steps until you’ve made each piece in your portfolio public on Kaggle. 

You have now uploaded your portfolio to Kaggle and can share your accomplishments with friends, family, colleagues, hiring managers, and potential employers. You can update your portfolio as your skills as a data analyst continue to grow.

Now, you can share your portfolio by going to the **Your work** tab on Kaggle and copying the link from the address bar. Share this link to show the world your hard work!
