This reading provides a checklist about what to include in your portfolio, where you can set up accounts to host your portfolio, and how to add content to your portfolio. 

## What to include

You learned that a portfolio represents your skills and showcases some of your previous projects to potential employers. Keep your portfolio:

-   **Personal:** Show who you are, what you are interested in, and what is important to you.
    
-   **Simple:** Display your work with easy navigation and without cluttered pages.
    
-   **Relevant:** Match your work to the skills included in job descriptions.
    
-   **Presentable:** Emphasize quality in the samples you show.  
    
-   **Unique:** Showcase your own work; cite sources of content to avoid plagiarism.
