## Selecting and developing a case study

In this course, you have options for selecting and developing a case study. You can choose one of two possible tracks. 

The first track has two cases already defined. You can pick one of these cases and follow through on the data analysis to answer the questions presented to address business problems. For more information, refer to the [track 1 details](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/supplement/bY66y/track-1-details "This link takes you to the details about Track 1: On the job."). 

The second track allows you to design your own case study about a topic that you are interested in. You can practice all but the Act phase of the Data Analysis Process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. For more information, refer to the [track 2 details](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/supplement/zbwbs/track-2-details "This link takes you to the details for Track 2: Choose your own adventure. "). You can also return to the [Six steps of data analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/lecture/JjA1f/six-steps-of-data-analysis) video to review the steps of the Data Analysis Process.

After familiarizing yourself with the details of each track, refer to the information in [Next steps: choosing your track](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/supplement/NTV8r/next-steps-choosing-your-track "This link takes you to further information to guide you about choosing your track.") and decide which track you want to follow.

## Creating your online portfolio

After completing your case study, you will create an online portfolio to store and display it. Refer to [Creating your online portfolio](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/supplement/m86c7/creating-your-online-portfolio "This link takes you to information about creating your online portfolio as part of this course."). It provides an overview of platforms that can potentially host your portfolio and case study. 

## Updating your LinkedIn profile

In an earlier course, you learned about creating an online presence with a LinkedIn account in [Getting started with LinkedIn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-preparation/supplement/3QDa4/getting-started-with-linkedin). Access your LinkedIn profile again to add a link to your online portfolio in your profile.

## Practicing your case study pitch

You can start to prepare for interviews by creating an elevator pitch for your case study. Refer to [What makes a great pitch](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/supplement/y5U2D/what-makes-a-great-pitch "This link takes you to sample interview questions for you to practice.") to understand the kinds of questions to prepare for. Try to include aspects of your elevator pitch in your answers to the sample questions provided in the reading. Then, practice pitching your case study as part of your planned responses to commonly asked interview questions.
