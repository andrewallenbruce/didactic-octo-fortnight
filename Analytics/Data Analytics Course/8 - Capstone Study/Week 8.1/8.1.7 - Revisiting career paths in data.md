## Mapping certificate skills to job requirements

The skills you gain with the Google Data Analytics Certificate align with skills that data analyst jobs require. When you create your resume, the way you present your skills can capture the attention of a recruiter or a hiring manager. Many career counselors recommend that you customize your resume each time you apply for a job so that your experience and skills align as closely as possible with the requirements listed in the job description.

For each of the relevant skills in the previous table, consider the following: 

-   Possible phrases from job descriptions
    
-   Examples of matching skills from this certificate 
    

Let’s go through the skills for data analysts and examine common phrases you might find in job descriptions.

## Aiming for more technical roles

If your goal is to work in a more technical role like a data scientist, the Google Data Analytics Certificate is a good starting point. But you might need to pursue additional learning opportunities to advance your skills, such as:

-   Completing other professional certificates (Coursera offers many)
    
-   Registering for college courses as a part-time or full-time student and applying for paid internships 
    
-   Continuing your education in a four-year college degree program like computer science, data science, or management information systems
