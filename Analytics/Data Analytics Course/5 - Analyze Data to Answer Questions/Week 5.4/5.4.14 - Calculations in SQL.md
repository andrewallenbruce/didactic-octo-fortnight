### In SQL, the symbols for the four basic arithmetic operations are:Â 

-   **+** addition
-   **-** subtraction
-   ***** multiplication
-   **/** division
-   **%** modulo - returns the remainder of a division calculation when included in a SQL query.

You add the statement ==**unit_price * quantity AS line_total**== to calculate the total price for each invoice and store it in a new column as line_total. 

The complete query is ==**SELECT invoice_line_id, invoice_id, unit_price, quantity, unit_price * quantity AS line_total FROM invoice_items LIMIT 5**==. 

The AS command gives a temporary name to the new column.

The total 0.99 appears in row 1 of your query result.
