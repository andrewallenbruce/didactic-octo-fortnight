In previous activities, you used basic spreadsheet functions such as COUNT, SUM, AVERAGE, and MAX. In this activity, you will work with the conditional versions of these functions: COUNTIF, SUMIF, AVERAGEIF, and MAXIFS.

**Conditional functions** are functions that perform a specific task, but only on cells that satisfy some defined criteria. They are usually identified with an IF suffix adjoined to the desired operation. They are frequently used when constructing more complex queries that cannot be accomplished using more basic functions.

By the time you complete this activity, you will be able to use conditional functions and understand when and why they are appropriate. This will enable you to do more complex analysis with spreadsheets as you continue to develop your data analyst’s skill set.

## Use the COUNTIF function 

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/-brCISTBS-G6wiEkwfvhdQ_1f93532e64694278bcfee9152158bbbf_yellowhorzbar.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=adHl08TfU6-prReC1BBmVWyy3HPm95LHALM4bjZsk2U)

First, open the Working with Conditions spreadsheet. 

Suppose you want to calculate the number of salespeople that the company has in New York state. The COUNTIF function allows you to do this easily. The syntax the COUNTIF is **=COUNTIF(range, criteria).**

The **range** is the array (or collection) of cells that you are checking and the **criteria** is what you are checking for. All cells in the array that match the provided criteria will be counted and this number returned as the value of the function.

 To use this function to count the number of salespeople working from “NY,” click on an open cell. In the function bar, type **=COUNTIF(B2:B21, "NY")**.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/HTxdZQgkQRS8XWUIJPEURQ_204f2a96ac994125945575aa12e22c05_DAC5M4L2SR1-ss1.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=Q8C7D8dA4SVOnL2sXd0z6prdShtEXG9xUI4R1ee0rjg)

Notice you've entered the range as the array of cells from **B2** to **B21**. This is all from column B with the exception of the column header. The function checks all cells in this array against the value “NY” (entered in quotes) which is the **criteria**. Every cell in this array with a value of “NY” will be counted, and the result is returned in the cell. It is 6 in this case.

Press **Enter** (Windows) or **Return** (Mac). The result should display like this:

As an alternative to entering the criteria "NY" into the **COUNTIF** function, you can achieve the same result by entering a cell address as the criteria. The function will then use the value of the cited cell as the criteria. For example, the cell **J10** has the value "NY." If you enter this in the function bar the **COUNTIF** function will seek out the value in cell **J10** and use it as the criteria. This gives the same result as before:

## Use the SUMIF function

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/KAb9svRZTy2G_bL0WR8t3g_184c6b1641ac434580da38b928f39304_yellowhorzbar.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=7C5gp5NNu7YFZVCYs1H01rYhSpbKkrNSEz-8sRPkT0w)

The **SUMIF** function is used to create a sum of the values of cells that meet a specific criteria. It supports the logical operators (>, <, <>, =). The syntax for this function is **=SUMIF(range, criteria, [sum_range] )**.

The input **range** is the array of cells that you check against the value of **criteria**. The **sum_range** is the array of values that you will sum up if the criteria is met. In this syntax above, the square brackets around sum_range indicate that this input is optional. However, you do not add square brackets when writing the function. If the argument **sum_range** is absent, then the SUMIF will sum the values in range by default.

As an example of this function, suppose that you want to create a sum of all sales more than $500.00. This can be executed as **=SUMIF(D2:D21, ">500").**

The result is:

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/J5cQ4ce7TuCXEOHHu97g2Q_aca8fe050ff74de48a3d7b15c482c95d_DAC5M4L2SR1-ss4.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=SyYUpDSMVQQgRa7XDVfNw5ThnvZP4hvSqL3wbRNMP7I)

Because you didn't include the sum_range input, all the values in the cells D2 to D21 that match the criteria were summed by default. To sum only the sales from New York, but not restrict to those greater than $500, type the following function: **=SUMIF(B2:B21, "NY", D2:D21).**

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/umIWThWlQaeiFk4VpVGnFQ_2cd0dd470700476ca2b130bd95218c93_DAC5M4L2SR1-ss5.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=yRsNV_ck0ra3LgrpiAukeQ8-AkfpoWmRmB3BecNUQ1A)

This results in: 

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/cxfYwQftRoaX2MEH7ZaGmA_bbd6d24ba97c4430b97b9868ef69b5c9_DAC5M4L2SR1-ss6.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=XkB0U_lC55N9IZEa7q-agfOWXDGwDkmjzVrBe9pp1X0)

Notice that in the SUMIF, the first input, **B2:B21**, is the range of cells that are checked for the criteria "NY" and the summing is done across the sum_range of cells **D2:D21** that have the state meeting the criteria "NY." This is different than in the first case. In that case, the array that you check is the same array that you sum across.

### Use the AVERAGEIF function

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/KAb9svRZTy2G_bL0WR8t3g_184c6b1641ac434580da38b928f39304_yellowhorzbar.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=7C5gp5NNu7YFZVCYs1H01rYhSpbKkrNSEz-8sRPkT0w)

Just like the previous two functions, the **AVERAGEIF** function will average the values in an array based on a given criteria. The syntax is **=AVERAGEIF(range, criteria, [sum_range]).**

 The inputs to this function, **range**, **criteria**, and **sum_range**, work in exactly the same manner as in the SUMIF function. Again, the sum_range is optional.

 Now, find the average sales per salesperson in New York. Type the following function: **=AVERAGEIF(B2:B21, "NY", D2:D21).**

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/BbcA5BK5SzO3AOQSuUszzw_49b4076b59b44967b1aa5a08cbe978a5_DAC5M4L2SR1-ss7.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=_eaY0St1eWZBvQ8WJ6WZ32pNPEyPYmTrijpzW5B02vI)

This yields 902.83333 as the result.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/NjN0zCujSo2zdMwro-qNwg_e400274afc674f569ea3df839f1735c6_DAC5M4L2SR1-ss8.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=nFAF9xRsxIYaGmhb7K6rOUB890iSN_Q5LQaKiqr2LBE)

## Use the MAXIFS function

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/zD_QrFagR2i_0KxWoBdoZw_d6757feaf5d941c88ddcedf616ac36d3_yellowhorzbar.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=NK98s6kvoHxJw_qcg2iAXu9a7NkmY7U6FGhN3YpqZE4)

The **MAXIFS** function is slightly different from the other three functions. The easiest way to observe the difference is to examine the syntax: **=MAXIFS(max_range, range1, criteria1, [range2], [criteria2], ...).**

-   **Note for Microsoft Excel users:** MAXIFS can only be used with an Office 365 subscription on Excel 2016 or newer. If you cannot use a version of Excel that allows the function MAXIFS, please use Google Sheets for this part of the activity.

The first argument, **max_range**, is the array over which you are finding the maximum. The second argument (**range1**) is the array you are checking. The third argument (**criteria1**) is the value that you are checking for. The inputs in the square brackets are for optional additional constraints.

Use this function to find the maximum sales from any salesperson in New York. Type the following: **=MAXIFS(D2:D21, B2:B21, "NY").**

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Y6Oih44RQiujooeOEYIrMg_b37b05327cd74b2bbaa845952a9197d8_DAC5M4L2SR1-ss9.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=xXu4V93nHQXm6Q53ZW-X52F5oeaFklx1jr_QeFyrhF4)

The resulting calculation is **1666.61**.

Remember, the order in which you enter the inputs matters. Try reversing the position of the arrays from the first example and type **=MAXIFS(B2:B21, D2:D21, "NY")**.

The result is **0**.

This is because you are asking the function to find the maximum of the array B2:B21 where the sales equal "NY". This is impossible because the values in the array D2:D21 (the sales array) are numerical. Therefore, none of them equals "NY," which is a string. The function returns 0 when nothing in the range meets the criteria.

The MAXIFS function can input more than one constraint. This is where the optional range2 and constraint2 come into play. Additional constraints follow the logic that every constraint must be satisfied for a cell in the max_range to be considered.

For example, to find the maximum sales in New York where the Max Item Cost is below $400, type the following into the function bar: **=MAXIFS(D2:D21, B2:B21, "NY", E2:E21, "<400").**

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/8h8x29EKSKufMdvRCtirjQ_9125ba35d4864d3fa1aedee64c227459_DAC5M4L2SR1-ss10-2.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=6WAZMEj_m-fKomaAsas68Gkmrx6wdVh0NeGu4AdGxdk)

The first three inputs are the same as above, but now you've added the additional constraint that Max Item Value must be less than $400. The array **E2:E21** is the Max Item array and its cells are checked against the criteria <400. The function returns the following, which is the maximum sales of any New York salesperson who did not sell any single item over (or equal to) $400.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Kdap5JNBTqOWqeSTQb6jXg_d859104006524b81be536e35532d9d1c_Screenshot-2021-03-04-8.33.23-PM.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=4Ey0mYP3NM_26s9VinW2_779qff0EnzPZtDMULpKEho)

Each of the previous functions—COUNTIF, SUMIF, and AVERAGEIF—have equivalents that work similarly to MAXIFS. These include COUNTIFS, SUMIFS, and AVERAGEIFS. The syntax and functionality of these functions, apart from the specific calculation, are identical to MAXIFS. For example, the SUMIFS function will give the sum for single and multiple constraints just like MAXIFS function does for the maximum. It also has the same syntax as MAXIFS.
