## Sorting with SQL

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/G-KePoi0R2Sinj6ItBdkMg_2d69ab4b929f40f2b472a78fdd5ed880_line-y.png?expiry=1628726400000&hmac=hpRsvhhyvjaVGeU_jMKG-oAtSPv940J-i7EnxoQIFaw)

To practice sorting data with SQL, you’ll query the CDC Births Data Summary public dataset. The queries you write will help you obtain some answers about which counties in the United States have the most and least births in the years 2016-2018. 

### Load the dataset

1. Log in to [BigQuery Sandbox](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/sandbox). If you have a free trial version of BigQuery, you can use that instead. On the BigQuery page, click the **Go to BigQuery** button.

-   **Note:** BigQuery Sandbox frequently updates its user interface. The latest changes may not be reflected in the screenshots presented in this activity, but the principles remain the same. Adapting to changes in software updates is an essential skill for data analysts, and it’s helpful for you to practice troubleshooting. You can also reach out to your community of learners on the discussion forum for help.

2. If you have never created a BigQuery project before, click **CREATE PROJECT** on the right side of the screen. If you have created a project before, you can use an existing one or create a new one by clicking the project dropdown in the blue header bar and selecting **NEW PROJECT**.

3. Name your project something that will help you identify it later. You can give it a unique project ID or use an auto-generated one. Don’t worry about selecting an organization if you don’t know what to put.

4. Now, you’ll see the **Editor** interface. In the middle of the screen is a window where you can type code, and to the left is the **Explorer** menu where you can search for datasets.

5. Click **+ ADD DATA** at the top of the Explorer menu**,** then **Explore public datasets** from the resulting dropdown.

6. In the **Search Marketplace** bar, type **sdoh_cdc_wonder_natality**.

7. Click the **CDC Births Data Summary**.

8. Click **View Dataset**. This will bring you back to the BigQuery Sandbox interface in a new tab.

-   **Note:** This may pin the **bigquery-public-data** dropdown to the **Explorer** menu. You can use this to browse datasets and tables.

9. Click back to the **Editor** tab. This is where you’ll use SQL during this activity.

10. Copy, paste, and run the following query to display the first 1,000 rows of the **county_natality** table:

After the query has run, your results should appear like this:

### Use the ORDER BY clause

Examine the dataset you just loaded. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the columns and get a feel for what each can tell you.

Now, imagine you were asked by your manager to figure out which 10 counties had the lowest birth count for 2016-2018. You could accomplish this by modifying your query to use the ORDER BY clause.

Copy, paste, and run the following query:

![](https://i.imgur.com/Ob7b6Ae.png)

The results of your query should appear like this:

![screenshot of query results](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/QjLaXhFbRHiy2l4RW1R4tQ_8836012b93ec4099be28d1a4e38ab563_DAC5M1L5SR2-ss2.png?expiry=1628726400000&hmac=ZQ2ZaHm9DYhqAlBvgdBgI_6RaqeN8Y7_ZiyFQiZM6M0)

You may have noticed that the query did not specify whether it should be sorted **ASC** (ascending) or **DESC** (descending). When this is not specified, SQL defaults to sorting by ascending order. You can run another query to confirm this. 

Copy, paste, and run the following query that includes ASC:

You’ll find that the results did not change. Notice that Tompkins County, NY, had just 735 births in 2018—the lowest birth count of any county in the US between 2016-2018.

### Use DESC to reverse sorting order

Now, modify the query to sort in the other direction, returning the top 10 counties with the highest yearly birth counts between 2016-2018.

Your results should appear like this:

![screenshot of query results](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Bx44pC1tRvOeOKQtbZbzrg_21300698dc494627b93e64d5371f8abb_DAC5M1L5SR2-ss4.png?expiry=1628726400000&hmac=n5LVaJGYW_G6LuzhYCyM9eUT0pCXRWo9yRWLvRVeRgY)

Now, the query returns the 10 rows with the largest values in the Birth column. Los Angeles County takes up the top three spots.

### Combine ORDER BY with WHERE clauses

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/jBNhaB29SRuTYWgdvekbFA_315281637411464698143e2f3748d1ad_shortline-y.png?expiry=1628726400000&hmac=9p60IC8m990aEIFxF-jbWPx7WJ5M4f0hPsCrQZe0cPA)

Next, modify the query so that it returns the top 10 counties with the highest birth counts for 2018 only. To do this, add a WHERE clause to the query that specifies only rows that have a Year value equal to 2018-01-01. Note how the ORDER BY clause comes after the WHERE clause. Copy, paste, and run the following query:

![](https://i.imgur.com/nISDDiM.png)

Your results should appear something like this:

![screenshot of query results](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/iHRPWXzZRhK0T1l82QYSOw_725ed3b4aa894f8cad0cd14a9accbb12_DAC5M1L5SR2-ss5.png?expiry=1628726400000&hmac=5UKRHQToi5gVZhJdB_YzGEvzW-RRwgFGPaEQrtYgwcw)

The query worked! You successfully used both ORDER BY and WHERE clauses in the same query.
