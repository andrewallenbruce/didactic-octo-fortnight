In this reading, we will describe the sorting and filtering options in Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel. Both offer basic sorting and filtering from set menu options. But, if you need more advanced sorting and filtering capabilities, you can use their respective **SORT** and **FILTER** functions.

## Sorting and filtering in Sheets

Sorting in Google Sheets helps you quickly spot trends in numbers. One trend might be gross revenue by sales region. In this case, you could sort the gross revenue column in **descending** (Z to A) order to spot the top performing regions at the top, or sort the gross revenue column in **ascending** (A-Z) order to spot the lowest performing regions at the top. Although an alphabetical order is implied, these sorting options do sort numbers, as our gross revenue example highlighted.

If you want to learn more about the set menu options for sorting and filtering, start with these resources:

-   [Sort data by selecting a range of data in a column](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcRBHXBMKBU "This link takes you to a YouTube video on how to sort data in a column in Google Sheets."): video of steps to achieve the task

In addition to the standard menu options, there is a SORT function for more advanced sorting. Use this function to create a custom sort. You can sort the rows of a given range of data by the values in one or more columns. And you get to set the sort criteria per column. Refer to the [SORT function](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093150?hl=en "This link takes you to the help page for the SORT function in Google Sheets.") page for the syntax. 

And like the SORT function, you can use the [FILTER function](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093197?hl=en "This link takes you to the Help page for the FILTER function in Google Sheets.") to filter by any matching criteria you like. This creates a custom filter. 

You might recall that you can filter data and then sort the filtered results. Using the FILTER and SORT functions together in a range of cells can programmatically and automatically achieve these results for you. 

## Sorting and filtering in Excel

You can also sort in ascending (A-Z) and descending (Z-A) order in Microsoft Excel. Excel offers **Smallest to Largest** and **Largest to Smallest** sorting when you are working with numbers. 

Similar to the SORT function in Google Sheets, Excel includes custom sort capabilities that are available from the menu. After you select the data range, click the **Sort & Filter** button to select the criteria for sorting. You can even sort by the data in rows instead of by the data in columns if you select **Sort left to right** under Options. (**Sort top to bottom** is the default setting to sort the data in columns.)
