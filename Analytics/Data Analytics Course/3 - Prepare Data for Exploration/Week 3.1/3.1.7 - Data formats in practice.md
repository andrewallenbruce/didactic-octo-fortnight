When you think about the word "format," a lot of things might come to mind. Think of an advertisement for your favorite store. You might find it in the form of a print ad, a billboard, or even a commercial. The information is presented in the format that works best for you to take it in. The format of a dataset is a lot like that, and choosing the right format will help you manage and use your data in the best way possible.

## Data format examples

As with most things, it is easier for definitions to click when we can pair them with real life examples. Review each definition first and then use the examples to lock in your understanding of each data format.

unstructured data: Data that is either not organized or organized in a highly superficial manner.

The data on Quick, Draw! is organized loosely based on the category, but not beyond that. Within each category, there is no organization. Unstructured data also has no established rule about how to compare two different pieces of data. On the other hand, structured data conforms to organizational rules.

In the example of the elephant: there are no rules that make one picture more elephant-like than any other. Rules are one way to structure data, as they can act as a test to help determine if a data point (in this case, an image) should or shouldnâ€™t be considered a picture of an elephant.

A good response would include how the data (i.e., the drawings) are vastly different across these three categories. In each category, the pictures also vary by a wide margin, almost as much as they do between categories.

Another thing to observe is that within a given category the pictures may be different, but consistent similarities persist. For example, virtually every picture of an elephant includes a trunk and big ears while pretty much every television will be rectangular and have an antenna.
