## Best practices for file naming conventions

Review the following file naming recommendations:

-   Work out and agree on file naming conventions early on in a project to avoid renaming files again and again.
    
-   Align your file naming with your team's or company's existing file-naming conventions.
    
-   Ensure that your file names are meaningful; consider including information like project name and anything else that will help you quickly identify (and use) the file for the right purpose.
    
-   Include the date and version number in file names; common formats are YYYYMMDD for dates and v## for versions (or revisions).
    
-   Create a text file as a sample file with content that describes (breaks down) the file naming convention and a file name that applies it.
    
-   Avoid spaces and special characters in file names. Instead, use dashes, underscores, or capital letters. Spaces and special characters can cause errors in some applications.
    

## Best practices for keeping files organized

Remember these tips for staying organized as you work with files:

-   Create folders and subfolders in a logical hierarchy so related files are stored together.
    
-   Separate ongoing from completed work so your current project files are easier to find. Archive older files in a separate folder, or in an external storage location.
    
-   If your files aren't automatically backed up, manually back them up often to avoid losing important work.
