Before you begin thinking about what sort of naming conventions and patterns you would use in your own projects, take a moment to review the best practices for file structure and naming conventions. 

When creating a file structure and naming convention pattern for a project, you should always:

-   Work out your conventions early in your project. The earlier you start, the more organized you’ll be. 
    
-   Align file naming conventions with your team. Conventions are most useful when everyone follows them.
    
-   Make sure filenames are meaningful. Stick to a consistent pattern that contains the most useful information needed.
    
-   Keep file names short and to the point.
    

This includes understanding the expected structure of folders and files in a project. Where does your data live? Your spreadsheets? Your data visualizations? Being able to navigate your folders easily makes for a well-structured project. 

Remember, there are some stylistic choices you’ll need to make when it comes to filename conventions. However, there are still best practices you should follow here, too:
