By now, you have been introduced to BigQuery, a data warehouse on Google Cloud that data analysts can use to query, filter large datasets, aggregate results, and perform complex operations. In this activity, you will explore the BigQuery interface; upload public data to your console; and write some simple SQL queries using SELECT, FROM, and WHERE. 

By the time you complete this activity, you will be more familiar with writing queries in the BigQuery interface. This will enable you to practice SQL, which is important for working with databases in your career as a data analyst.

### Access public data in BigQuery

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/GEzNGae6QXOMzRmnutFzRQ_a0547d3619d14ca08a57efd29b43ce36_shortline-y.png?expiry=1628121600000&hmac=e9Qqudt-w7nEK_YoaqPjnsDoeWUubnWaOY2_OOYbORQ)

In order to actually start writing queries, you will need some data to work with. Once you’re familiar with the BigQuery interface, you can access a public dataset directly from your console. 

1. Click on the **+ ADD DATA** button in the **Explorer menu** **pane** and select **Explore public datasets****_._** This will open a new menu where you can search public datasets that are already available through Google Cloud.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/1SKhZOAMQ0eioWTgDLNHRQ_2c10e28f5a4947ccbede0541c152ddf1_IntrotoBQ3.png?expiry=1628208000000&hmac=8s9Pj-K3r4SymnAqzz6idaewAoeLPR_y9qGnvqb4j3Y)

2. In the dataset menu you just opened, **type** **_london bicycle_** in the search box at the top; this will return the London Bicycle Hires dataset from the Greater London Authority. **Click the dataset** for more details.

3. From the dataset information page, **click the blue** **VIEW DATASET** button. This will open your console in a new tab with this dataset loaded. 

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/YXfGR21uT5K3xkdtbn-Sxw_d61163cde7794e058318438d923108f1_IntrotoBQ5.png?expiry=1628208000000&hmac=TsmVpqMv2sadaAJIOzk0tl1dC3-LRCuD9gkwMQSoGLw)

You'll notice that **bigquery-public-data** is now pinned in your Explorer pane. You can now explore and query these public datasets. 

4. Click on **the arrow** next to **bigquery-public-data** and scroll down the list of public datasets until you find the **london_bicycles** data. When you click on the dataset, it will list two tables. Click on **cycle_hire**.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/jbX54HmIQiS1-eB5iCIk_g_78e35d1514ec402b89927889d55d01f1_IntrotoBQ6.png?expiry=1628208000000&hmac=RiFHKcQBm2dJN_wbf7g-E07MKzywFIGzeR7ubFG8kEk)

This will pull up a new tab in your Query Editor with information about the table schema. 

5. After checking out the table schema, you can take a peek into what data the cycle_hire table contains by clicking on the **Preview** tab. This will give you a better idea of what kind of data you’ll be working with.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/gxREBVEkSPKURAVRJLjy-g_c41d9aefd5a44c40a1dfc6ff01ef12f1_IntrotoBQ7.png?expiry=1628208000000&hmac=kPDww0svkG-GARAeyet13pPKPhJ0VCRSofKMKaI-_Zk)

Once you have finished previewing the data, you can write a query!

## Query your data

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/G-KePoi0R2Sinj6ItBdkMg_2d69ab4b929f40f2b472a78fdd5ed880_line-y.png?expiry=1628121600000&hmac=Yn381LsD-vN9cKzUMKyg_32LqvJms8mmmnAWYV-TRyg)

So far, you’ve learned three basic parts of a query: SELECT, FROM, and WHERE. As a refresher, here are what those basic parts represent in the query: 

-   **SELECT** is the section of a query that indicates what data you want SQL to return to you
-   **FROM** is the section of a query that indicates which table the desired data comes from. 
-   **WHERE** is the section of a query that indicates any filters you’d like to apply to your dataset

### Write a basic query

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/GEzNGae6QXOMzRmnutFzRQ_a0547d3619d14ca08a57efd29b43ce36_shortline-y.png?expiry=1628121600000&hmac=e9Qqudt-w7nEK_YoaqPjnsDoeWUubnWaOY2_OOYbORQ)

Now, construct a simple command using the basic parts of a query you have already learned! For example, you can select a specific column from the cycle_hire table, such as the **end_station_name** column.  

1. Start your query with a **SELECT clause** and indicate which column you want to select from the table; in this case, you’ll input **end_station_name**. 

2. After you have indicated which column you are selecting, write your **FROM** **clause**. You will need to specify the table you are querying from by inputting the following location: **`bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire`**; 

The completed query should appear like this:

SELECT 

 end_station_name 

FROM 

 `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire`;

3. Run your completed query by clicking on the blue **RUN** button. 

This query may take a few seconds to execute. Once it has finished, you will find the list of station names you requested under the **Query Results** console pane. 

### Write a query to answer a question

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/GEzNGae6QXOMzRmnutFzRQ_a0547d3619d14ca08a57efd29b43ce36_shortline-y.png?expiry=1628121600000&hmac=e9Qqudt-w7nEK_YoaqPjnsDoeWUubnWaOY2_OOYbORQ)

After running the first basic query, try answering a specific question about the data. For example, what were the rental_ids for all bike trips that lasted for 20 minutes or longer?

1. Click **COMPOSE NEW QUERY** to start a new query. Start with your **SELECT statement** again. This time, you will want to include all of the columns in the table for this query. You can use an asterisk to indicate that you are selecting all of the data like this: SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_of_trips 

2. Then you will add your **FROM statement**. You will be using the same dataset as the previous query: FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire`.

3. Finally, you’ll add a **WHERE** statement to specify that you want to filter for only bike rides 20 minutes or longer. If you check the preview of this data, you might notice that the duration is recorded in seconds, so you’ll specify 1200 seconds in your query.  You can write that as WHERE duration>=1200;

Your completed query should be written like this:

SELECT 

 COUNT(*) AS num_of_trips 

FROM 

 `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire` 

WHERE 

 duration >= 1200;

4. Run your completed query by clicking on the blue **RUN** button.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/LwjQ0b0HShWI0NG9B3oVMA_5cc82cee7b08406197b425451d765cf1_IntrotoBQ8.png?expiry=1628208000000&hmac=9kF4_wX6qgNaVPGJLEpd6YjoD2tGOGOf6yiL7AQ26p0)

This query may take a few seconds to execute. Once it has finished, you will find a list of rides from this table that fit your criteria. There are more than 7 million rows with bike trips that are 20 minutes or longer!

### Up for a challenge?

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/GEzNGae6QXOMzRmnutFzRQ_a0547d3619d14ca08a57efd29b43ce36_shortline-y.png?expiry=1628121600000&hmac=e9Qqudt-w7nEK_YoaqPjnsDoeWUubnWaOY2_OOYbORQ)

If you’re comfortable using queries to answer questions, try creating and running queries to answer any of the questions below: 

-   What are the names of the stations that bike_id 1710 started from?
-   How many bike_ids have ended at "Moor Street, Soho"?
-   What is the station_id for "Canton Street, Poplar"?
-   What is the name of the station whose ID is 111?
-   How many distinct bike_ids had trip durations greater than 2400 seconds (or 40 minutes)?
