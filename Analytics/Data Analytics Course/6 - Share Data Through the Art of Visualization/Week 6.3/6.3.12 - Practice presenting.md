Before you create your presentation, you need to capture screenshots from the Tableau dashboard you created in the previous activity, [Hands-On Activity: Create your first Tableau dashboard](https://www.coursera.org/learn/visualize-data/quiz/TT03O/hands-on-activity-creating-your-first-tableau-dashboard). 

1. Go to Tableau Online and log in to your account. Retrieve the dashboard you created from the **Recents** page.

The way you capture screenshots will differ based on the operating system you are using. Here are some pointers on how to save your visualizations:

2. Click the **download icon** in the toolbar, then **Image** from the dropdown menu. This will save the visualization you created as a .png file, which you can insert into a slide presentation.

**OR**

3. Take a screenshot of each visualization using the command that corresponds to your operating system:

-   Chromebook: Press **Ctrl** + **Show windows** icon (For non-Chrome OS keyboards, press **Ctrl** + **F5**).
-   Mac: Press **Shift** + **Command** + **4.**
-   Windows: Use the snipping tool—refer to this [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots-00246869-1843-655f-f220-97299b865f6b#take-screen-capture-print-screen=windows-7) page.

**Note:** If you do not find your computer or laptop listed above, please refer to your manufacturer’s reference guide or search online for a quick tutorial.

## Prepare a presentation

Now that you have your dashboard screenshots, it’s time to create your presentation.

To prepare your presentation, you should first consider your audience. In this activity, you will build a presentation for an audience of stakeholders. They aren’t closely involved in the project, but are curious about the analysis you have completed, the dashboard you have produced, and your key findings. Next, you can create your slides. 

The first slide in your presentation should be a title slide, including the title of your presentation, your name, and the date of your presentation. Each of the next slides should have one or two of your dashboard screenshots. They should also include bullet points describing the context of your screenshots. Finally, you should include a closing slide with your final take-aways. 

For this simple presentation, you only need a few simple slides. In future presentations, you will include more specific information and therefore need more slides. 

Next, you can create your slides in presentation software.

### Create your slides

To create your slides, use whichever presentation software you feel comfortable with. If you’re unsure of which one to use or don’t own presentation software, use one of these free options:

-   [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/) (Google account required)
-   [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/free-office-online-for-the-web) (Microsoft account required)
-   [Prezi](https://prezi.com/) (login required)

### Record yourself

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/oXqvKdjuRRG6rynY7pURbQ_fbf27bd251534df3827331b928074cfe_shortline-y.png?expiry=1628985600000&hmac=eoGH96w8vh-lxZqEMEBczrmCT6yBIU0T_OEsx-XKV60)

Use a smartphone, digital camera, or computer webcam to record a video of yourself presenting the visualizations you created. You can use [Screencastify](https://www.screencastify.com/ "Screencastify screen capture software") or a free trial of [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/download/camtasia/ "Camtasia Free Trial Download") to record the slides of your presentation. Deliver your presentation in 2 to 3 minutes. Check that your lighting is bright enough and the focus of your lens captures a clear image. Then upload your file to your computer.

## Evaluating your presentation

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/G-KePoi0R2Sinj6ItBdkMg_2d69ab4b929f40f2b472a78fdd5ed880_line-y.png?expiry=1628985600000&hmac=acJ_GfQUGpgJEETdUEnOrwQasfKJpzIHeAN4CYFHzS0)

Watch the video of your presentation. As you watch it, go through the following checklist. Each point is related to a best practice for presentations. 

Do you:

-   Use an attention-grabbing opening?
-   Start with broad ideas and later talk about specific details?
-   Speak in short sentences?
-   Pause for five seconds after showing a data visualization?
-   Pause intentionally at certain points?
-   Keep the pitch of your voice level?
-   Stand still and move with purpose?
-   Maintain good posture?
-   Look at your audience (or camera) while speaking?
-   Keep your message concise?
-   End by explaining why the data analysis matters?

### Evaluate your slide deck

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/oXqvKdjuRRG6rynY7pURbQ_fbf27bd251534df3827331b928074cfe_shortline-y.png?expiry=1628985600000&hmac=eoGH96w8vh-lxZqEMEBczrmCT6yBIU0T_OEsx-XKV60)

Next, it’s time to evaluate your slide deck. Watch your video again. As you watch it, consider the following questions. Each question is related to a best practice for slide decks. 

Do you:

-   Include a good title and subtitle that describe what you’re about to present?
-   Include the date of your presentation or the date when your slideshow was last updated?
-   Use a font size that lets the audience easily read your slides?
-   Showcase what business metrics you used?
-   Include effective visuals (like charts and graphs)?

After you complete this checklist, save it for later. If your presentation did not check off every best practice, don’t worry. Later in this course, you will learn more presentation skills so you can rerecord and reevaluate this presentation.
