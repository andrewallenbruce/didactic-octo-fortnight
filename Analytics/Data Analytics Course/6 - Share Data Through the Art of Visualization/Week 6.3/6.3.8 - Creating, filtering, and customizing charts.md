![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/G-KePoi0R2Sinj6ItBdkMg_2d69ab4b929f40f2b472a78fdd5ed880_line-y.png?expiry=1628985600000&hmac=acJ_GfQUGpgJEETdUEnOrwQasfKJpzIHeAN4CYFHzS0)

**Important note:** The following steps are for Google Sheets but they can help guide you to similar features in Excel. Refer to the Additional resources section if you need more specific instructions for creating charts in Excel. 1. In the spreadsheet that you copied or downloaded, practice creating a chart by clicking the second tab named **Create your chart here**. This tab contains the total purchases calculated for each store from the first tab. All of the original data is preserved in the first tab so you can explore chart creation in the second tab without changing or deleting any of the original data.

2. Highlight cells **B3** through **C7** as the data for your chart.

3. From the main menu, click Insert, and select Chart.

4. A chart is created automatically and a chart editor opens on the right so you can change the chart type. If a pie chart is displayed, click the **Chart type** drop-down and select a column chart so your chart looks like the one below.

5. To filter the data shown in the column chart, make sure the **pink row 3** is highlighted and then click the **filter** **icon** in the toolbar. (The filter icon is the second icon from the right in the toolbar.) This adds a filter icon in each column of your data.

6. Click the filter icon for **Store Name** and uncheck **Candy's Beauty Supply**.

![Store name column is highlighted and filter drop-down menu is selected](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Vwn4RkdAT4CJ-EZHQM-AMw_99b8684b7038467ca4d27eb0d11ed704_Screenshot-2021-04-16-11.50.44-AM.png?expiry=1628985600000&hmac=1L7HOJFeExv2ClV1L0zyFQ16a7Jt-ygTt2pDaTJioa0)

7. Click **OK** and your chart will automatically update to exclude the data for Candy's Beauty Supply, as shown below.

**Note:** To include the data for Candy's Beauty Supply again, simply click the filter icon for Store Name and click Candy's Beauty Supply to add the check mark back.

### Applying Styles

You can also apply different styles to the chart. For example, the default blue in the chart isn't the most appropriate for accessibility when the background is white.

1. Double-click the chart to open the chart editor.

2. Click **Series** in the chart editor to expand the options.

3. Under **Format**, click the drop-down for **Fill color**, and select **Custom**.

4. Change the **Hex value** for the color from **#4a86e8** to one of the blue hues recommended for use on white backgrounds for accessibility. The difference between the current color and these accessible colors may seem minimal, but a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 is important for people who cannot see the full color spectrum. Read through the [Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh's accessibility guidelines](http://web-accessibility.carnegiemuseums.org/design/color/) to learn more about web accessibility guidelines.
