Choosing a data visualization to communicate your message may seem more like an art than a science. Fortunately, a **decision tree** can help you select the best visualization. To construct a decision tree, you simply need a basic understanding of design principles and the necessary knowledge of your data, message, and audience. This process will help add some structure to your decision making process, making it easier to pick the right data visualization.

First, take a moment to review some of the design concepts and best practices you’ve learned so far.

### Create successful data visualizations

Recall that there are four elements of successful data visualization:

-   **Information:** reflects the _conclusion_ you’ve drawn from the data, which you will communicate with visualization
-   **Story:** adds _meaning_ to the data and makes it _interesting_
-   **Goals:** makes the _data_ usable and _useful_
-   **Visual form:** creates both _beauty_ and _structure_

Where just two or three ovals overlap, there are different types of incomplete data visualization. At the center, where all four overlap, contains the words “successful visualization”. This visualization stresses the idea that all four elements are necessary to create a successful data visualization.

Keep these elements in mind as you review the scenario below. This will help you make better data visualizations by helping you connect the information you want to communicate with your audience and your goals.

Here are additional best practices that are helpful to keep in mind:

-   Your audience should know what they are observing within five seconds of being shown a data visualization. Visuals should be clear and easy to follow. 

-   In the five seconds after that, your audience should understand the conclusion your visualization is making—even if they aren’t familiar with your research. 

-   As long as it’s not misleading, you should visually represent only the data that your audience needs in order to understand your findings. Including irrelevant data may confuse, distract, or overwhelm your audience.
