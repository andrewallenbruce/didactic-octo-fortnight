A data visualization, sometimes referred to as a “data viz,” allows analysts to properly interpret data. A good way to think of data visualization is that it can be the difference between utter confusion and really grasping an issue. Creating effective data visualizations is a complex task; there is a lot of advice out there, and it can be difficult to grasp it all. In this reading, you are going to learn some tips and tricks for creating effective data visualizations. First, you'll review two frameworks that are useful for thinking about how you can organize the information in your visualization. Second, you'll explore pre-attentive attributes and how they can be used to affect the way people think about your visualizations. From there, you'll do a quick review of the design principles that you should keep in mind when creating your visualization. You will end the reading by reviewing some practices that you can use to avoid creating misleading or inaccurate visualizations. 

## Frameworks for organizing your thoughts about visualization

Frameworks can help you organize your thoughts about data visualization and give you a useful checklist to reference. Here are two frameworks that may be useful for you as you create your own data viz: 

**1)** [**The McCandless Method**](https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/what-makes-a-good-data-visualization/ "The McCandless Method")

You learned about the David McCandless method in the first lesson on effective data visualizations, but as a refresher, the McCandless Method lists four elements of good data visualization: 

1.  **Information**: the data you are working with
    
2.  **Story**: a clear and compelling narrative or concept
    
3.  **Goal**: a specific objective or function for the visual
    
4.  **Visual form**: an effective use of metaphor or visual expression
    

Note: One useful way of approaching this framework is to notice the parts of the graphic where there is incomplete overlap between all four elements. For example, visual form without a goal, story, or data could be a sketch or even art. Data plus visual form without a goal or function is eye candy. Data with a goal but no story or visual form is boring. All four elements need to be at work to create an effective visual.

**2)** [**Kaiser Fung’s Junk Charts Trifecta Checkup**](https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/junk-charts-trifecta-checkup-the-definitive-guide.html "Kaiser Fung’s Junk Charts Trifecta Checkup")

This approach is a useful set of questions that can help consumers of data visualization critique what they are consuming and determine how effective it is. The Checkup has three questions:

1.  What is the practical question? 
    
2.  What does the data say?
    
3.  What does the visual say? 
    

Note: This checklist helps you think about your data viz from the perspective of your audience and decide if your visual is communicating your data effectively to them or not. In addition to these frameworks, there are some other building blocks that can help you construct your data visualizations. 

## Pre-attentive attributes: marks and channels

Creating effective visuals means leveraging what we know about how the brain works, and then using specific visual elements to communicate the information effectively. **Pre-attentive attributes** are the elements of a data visualization that people recognize automatically without conscious effort. The essential, basic building blocks that make visuals immediately understandable are called marks and channels. 

### **Marks**

**Marks** are basic visual objects like points, lines, and shapes. Every mark can be broken down into four qualities:

1.  **Position** - Where a specific mark is in space in relation to a scale or to other marks

One is red and one is blue, and there is obvious space between them.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/A00ISJzEQQaNCEicxAEGBg_4983576b05bf4916b8cba2b208871c99_Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-2.27.14-PM.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=2f94w8A45XwWU1I3CrGpMXGrEC1HkSt4o9mUY672CB8)

2. **Size** - How big, small, long, or tall a mark is

![a plot with points that are different sizes](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Exiu37tuRpmYrt-7bsaZRQ_336a757859ff486fa11b24d497e0e896_Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-2.28.18-PM.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=BabNJoEoQA7Mk0MmwXa1XZbpUW45FnNrv2jiQ4AIfsA)

3. **Shape** - Whether a specific object is given a shape that communicates something about it

![horizontal bar chart, but bars are made of icons shaped like people](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/VNLUy33dQz2S1Mt93RM9_Q_4b595a6f37cb41dd976e46b6549d8560_Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-2.29.10-PM.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=I9AdOp1Q6Oa2ts77bBLK3u52OVMOc8BvkEiBxhnZYeE)

4. **Color** - What color the mark is

![a bar chart with a red, green, yellow, grey, and blue bar](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Q637T4WmRXyt-0-FpoV8UA_7d407b54698b4a589c45af4c835022d0_Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-2.30.10-PM.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=gqjrOd5HbN0lZ8YyWCOTFm9xs82W3jMiYWpZEAn5_Gs)

### **Channels**

**Channels** are visual aspects or variables that represent characteristics of the data. Channels are basically marks that have been used to visualize data. Channels will vary in terms of how effective they are at communicating data based on three elements: 

1. **Accuracy** - Are the channels helpful in accurately estimating the values being represented?

For example, color is very accurate when communicating categorical differences, like apples and oranges. But it is much less effective when distinguishing quantitative data like 5 from 5.5.

![a plot with apples and oranges representing the data points](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/sbKIlqq1S8WyiJaqtUvF9g_87b1d428718c41b7ba92a01b05e76fb8_Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-2.31.26-PM.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=mPMSnndkv0hsia-a-P4lC1IektfS44WrgXNfPpo0ipo)

2. **Popout** - How easy is it to distinguish certain values from others?

There are many ways of drawing attention to specific parts of a visual, and many of them leverage pre-attentive attributes like line length, size, line width, shape, enclosure, hue, and intensity.

![a line chart with three blue lines and one red line](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/ygexACupR8mHsQArqUfJng_0df1bba9f92b42dea24c2abb2530408f_Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-4.09.21-PM.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=3i3tkFk-M9ecrgVRQ2lnvh1ABvbjjf-qopDCzlU_lLk)

3. **Grouping** - How good is a channel at communicating groups that exist in the data?

Consider the proximity, similarity, enclosure, connectedness, and continuity of the channel.

![ bar chart with four groups of bars. In each group, there is a red bar and a blue bar](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/YF6tIDR4QSGerSA0eAEhWA_922c18f77004447db6bcacbfe1b60588_Screen-Shot-2021-02-26-at-2.33.30-PM.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=s_h6yU9tfuA07-wzP6P7ytHaL3FtAPYFSbzv0CAG47w)

But, remember: the more you emphasize different things, the less that emphasis counts. The more you emphasize one single thing, the more that counts. 

## Design principles

Once you understand the pre-attentive attributes of data visualization, you can go on to design principles for creating effective visuals. These design principles are important to your work as a data analyst because they help you make sure that you are creating visualizations that communicate your data effectively to your audience. By keeping these rules in mind, you can plan and evaluate your data visualizations to decide if they are working for you and your goals. And, if they aren’t, you can adjust them!

## Avoiding misleading or deceptive charts 

![A line graph with several colorful lines going in different directions. It is intentionally difficult to read](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/gfKaF2FWQMyymhdhVvDMmQ_5a00fc067dae47ba8c8820e8db364349_DAC6M1L2R1-H.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=bjDqUM65h07JR6_sPXJTv7ozUPaKjEezZO4Kovwxp-k)

As you are considering what kind of visualization to create and how to design it, you will want to be sure that you are not creating misleading or deceptive charts. As you have been learning, data analysis provides people with insights and knowledge they can use to make decisions. So, it is important that the visualizations you create are communicating your data accurately and truthfully. Here are some common errors to avoid so that your visualizations aren’t accidentally misleading:

Finally, keep in mind that data visualization is an art form, and it takes time to develop these skills. Over your career as a data analyst, you will not only learn how to design good data visualizations, but you will also learn how to evaluate good data visualizations. Use these tips to think critically about data visualization—both as a creator and as an audience member.
