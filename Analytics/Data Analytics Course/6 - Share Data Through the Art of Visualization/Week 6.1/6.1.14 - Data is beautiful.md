At this point, you might be asking yourself: What makes a good visualization? Is it the data you use? Or maybe it is the story that it tells? In this reading, you are going to learn more about what makes data visualizations successful by exploring David McCandless’ elements of successful data visualization and evaluating three examples based on those elements. Data visualization can change our perspective and allow us to notice data in new, beautiful ways. A picture is worth a thousand words—that’s true in data too! You will have the option to save all of the data visualization examples that are used throughout this reading; these are great examples of successful data visualization that you can use for future inspiration.

![Four overlapping ovals outlining the four different parts of data visualization: information, story, goal, and visual form](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/9uQ2-C0ITLikNvgtCNy44g_62b8f3cdf2c24b4a9512e77f4d602939_Screen-Shot-2021-02-28-at-7.03.08-PM.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=_vmCNKG6qWG_X7K0DpUrlM7qfXRU8yr9J2-ChqnYSoU)

Where just two or three ovals overlap, there are different types of incomplete data visualization. At the center, where all four overlap, contains the words “successful visualization”. This visualization stresses the idea that all four elements are necessary to create a successful data visualization

## Four elements of successful visualizations

The Venn diagram by David McCandless identifies four elements of successful visualizations: 

-   **Information (data):** The information or data that you are trying to convey is a key building block for your data visualization. Without information or data, you cannot communicate your findings successfully.
    
-   **Story (concept):** Story allows you to share your data in meaningful and interesting ways. Without a story, your visualization is informative, but not really inspiring. 
    
-   **Goal (function):** The goal of your data visualization makes the data useful and usable. This is what you are trying to achieve with your visualization. Without a goal, your visualization might still be informative, but can’t generate actionable insights.
    
-   **Visual form (metaphor):** The visual form element is what gives your data visualization structure and makes it beautiful. Without visual form, your data is not visualized yet. 
    

All four of these elements are important on their own, but a successful data visualization balances all four. For example, if your data visualization has only two elements, like the information and story, you have a rough outline. This can be really useful in your early planning stages, but is not polished or informative enough to share. Even three elements are not quite enough— you need to consider all four to create a successful data visualization.

In the next part of this reading, you will use these elements to examine three data visualization examples and evaluate why they are successful. 

## Example 1: visualization of lifespan data 

![Vertical bar chart titled “Live Long: What really extends a lifespan?” ](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/8TYXyzcKTqy2F8s3Cs6saA_2c162789172142ca8822f3db51fdd7b2_Screen-Shot-2021-02-28-at-7.05.22-PM.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=XHoIWTfd6c2R8ZtpkQPxiNSxN2xbPbS5QBvjxVhRX0g)

The scale of years added or subtracted from a lifespan ranges from negative ten to positive twenty. Each bar is color-coded depending on how strong the science backing each data finding is; light orange bars are labeled “suggestive,” dark orange bars are “good,” and green bars are “strong.” There are also icons to indicate if the data findings are gender-specific. Finally, the visualization includes text commentary on each data point.

### **Examine the four elements**

This data visualization uses all four elements that were previously introduced. Here is how they are all working together to make the visualization successful: 

-   **Information (data):** The data is organized and outlined in the visualization, so this visualization clearly is based on plenty of information or data. 
    
-   **Story (concept):** The concept behind this data visualization is clearly stated in the title: finding out what really extends a lifespan. But, the visualization also uses the data gathered and presented earlier to put together the ultimate recipe for a long life, which is a nice ending to the overarching story being told in this visualization. 
    
-   **Goal (function):** The goal of this data visualization is also pretty clear from the title: It is trying to find out what can extend someone’s lifespan, which might help people make better choices about their own lives. 
    
-   **Visual form (metaphor):** The data visualization uses a lot of visual components to help structure the information. First, it has been organized as a horizontal bar chart and has both years lost and years gained as a result of particular choices. This makes it easier to read each choice and the commentary. It also draws your eye downward so that you have to read all of the elements before you get to the ultimate recipe at the end. This data visualization also uses color to communicate how strong the science behind each finding was, which makes this data visualization beautiful and informative. 
    

## Example 2: visualization of dog breed comparison

![Data visualization titled “Best in Show: The Ultimate Data Dog” with dog breeds measured by data score and popularity.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/6afFrxbJTmWnxa8WyR5lFQ_e808d49c36c54a23807d9a4e72a2f62f_Screen-Shot-2021-02-28-at-7.09.53-PM.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=infkCgW2qwmVx68UylEDJtS4_2cEe-SUJFwhTGtmbYI)

It uses two axes, popularity and data score, to place different dog breeds on a four-square chart. The squares are labelled “Inexplicably Overrated,” “The Rightly Ignored,” “Hot Dogs!,” and “Overlooked Treasures.” Different dog breeds, visualized with plotted points shaped like dogs, are distributed on the chart based on their popularity and their data score.

### **Examine the four elements**

This visualization compares the popularity of different dog breeds to a more objective data score. Consider how it uses the elements of successful data visualization:

-   **Information (data):** If you view the data, you can explore the metrics being illustrated in the visualization. 
    
-   **Story (concept):** The visualization shows which dogs are overrated, which are rightly ignored, and those that are really hot dogs! And, the visualization reveals some overlooked treasures you may not have known about previously.
    
-   **Goal (function):** The visualization is interested in exploring the relationship between popularity and the objective data scores for different dog breeds. By comparing these data points, you can learn more about how different dog breeds are perceived. 
    
-   **Visual form (metaphor):** In addition to the actual four-square structure of this visualization, other visual cues are used to communicate information about the dataset. The most obvious is that the data points are represented as dog symbols. Further, the size of a dog symbol and the direction the dog symbol faces communicate other details about the data.  
    

## Example 3: visualization of rising sea levels

![Visualization titled “When Sea Levels Attack!” ](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/awO5nXmjRIiDuZ15o5SIOw_677bc464f8da478cb3893e12682d652c_Screen-Shot-2021-02-28-at-7.11.28-PM.png?expiry=1628812800000&hmac=dhi-rme3BS6IAPwyRECbcsdRHIYE356rmX3OGlO2y2U)

demonstrates how much sea levels are projected to rise over the course of 8,000 years. On the y-axis, it lists both the number of years and the sea level in meters. From right to left, starting with the lowest sea level, the chart includes silhouettes of different cities around the world to demonstrate how long it would take for most of the world to be underwater. It also includes inset maps of the continents and how they would appear at different times as sea levels continue to rise.

### **Examine the four elements**

This When Sea Levels Attack visualization illustrates how much sea levels are projected to rise over the course of 8,000 years. The silhouettes of different cities with different sea levels, rising from right to left, helps to drive home how much of the world will be affected as sea levels continue to rise. Here is how this data visualization stacks up using the four elements of successful visualization:

-   **Information (data):** This visualization uses climate data on rising sea levels from a variety of sources, including NASA and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In addition to that data, it also uses recorded sea levels from around the world to help illustrate how much rising sea levels will affect the world. 
    
-   **Story (concept):** The visualization tells a very clear story: Over the course of 8,000 years, much of the world as we know it will be underwater. 
    
-   **Goal (function):** The goal of this project is to demonstrate how soon rising sea levels are going to affect us on a global scale. Using both data and the visual form, this visualization makes rising sea levels feel more real to the audience. 
    
-   **Visual form (metaphor):** The city silhouettes in this visualization are a beautiful way to drive home the point of the visualization. It gives the audience a metaphor for how rising sea levels will affect the world around them in a way that showing just the raw numbers can’t do. And for a more global perspective, the visualization also uses inset maps. 
    

## Key takeaways

Notice how all of these visualizations balance all four elements of successful visualization. They clearly incorporate data, use storytelling to make that data meaningful, focus on a specific goal, and structure the data with visual forms to make it beautiful and communicative. The more you practice thinking about these elements, the more you will be able to include them in your own data visualizations.
