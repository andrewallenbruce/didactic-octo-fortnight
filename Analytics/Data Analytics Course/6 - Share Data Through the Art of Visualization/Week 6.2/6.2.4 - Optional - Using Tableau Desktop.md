In addition to accessing Tableau Public online, you can download a desktop version to create and upload data visualizations directly from your computer. **Tableau Desktop** is part of the Tableau Creator subscription, but you can start a free 14-day trial by downloading Tableau Desktop from their website. In order to access the desktop version, you will need a compatible device since Tableau Desktop doesn’t work on mobile devices or Chromebooks.

This reading will help you download Tableau Desktop, if you want to try it out.

**I​mportant note:** All hands-on activities are based on the use of Tableau Public. You don't need to download Tableau Desktop to complete the activities.

## Features 

Tableau Public is a great free resource, and it allows you to explore a lot of data visualizations online. But the desktop version has features that can help make Tableau an even more powerful tool. Using Tableau Desktop you can:

-   Interact with and combine data from more sources
    
-   Save data visualizations locally to your device
    
-   Keep your work more private and secure
    
-   Build calculations and visualize them live in-platform
    
-   Access built-in maps of over 50 countries
    
-   Share your creations with specific users
    

The Tableau Creator subscription also gives you access to other useful tools, like Tableau Prep Builder, which can help you prepare your data for visualization and immediately use it.
