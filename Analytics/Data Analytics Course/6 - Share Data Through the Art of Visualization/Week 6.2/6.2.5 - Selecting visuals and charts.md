The key to effective presentations is data visualizations that are clear and convincing. In turn, the key to effective visualizations is selecting the best way to depict your data.Â 

You have learned about a few types of visualizations (e.g., bar graphs, pie charts) and what each type is best at emphasizing. Determining which type of visualization to use is essential to giving your presentation the impact it needs.

So far, you have considered a few rules about what makes a helpful data visualization:

-   **Five-second rule:** A data visualization should be **clear, effective, and convincing** enough to be absorbed in five seconds or less.
-   **Color contrast:** Graphs and charts should use a **diverging color palette** to show contrast between elements.
-   **Conventions and expectations:** Visuals and their organization should align with **audience expectations** and **cultural conventions**. For example, if the majority of your audience associates green with a positive concept and red with a negative one, your visualization should reflect this.
-   **Minimal labels:** Titles, axes, and annotations should use as **few labels** as it takes to make sense. Having too many labels makes your graph or chart too busy. It takes up too much space and prevents the labels from being shown clearly.
