While delivering a presentation to an audience, your primary goal is to respond to a business task. A **business task** is a question or problem you use data to solve—and a presentation demonstrates how to solve it. Business tasks can have a variety of contexts and scopes, so the details of your presentation will depend on a lot of factors.

Sometimes, you may receive questions or objections about your presentation. This is normal, as your audience wants to understand your presentation as completely as possible. Responding to these questions and objections in a clear, concise, and polite manner is crucial to delivering an effective presentation.

## Examples of objections

Consider the following situations where a data analyst delivers a presentation and receives an objection:

1.  An analyst is presenting on the sales revenue of their company’s new product: an autonomous vacuum cleaning robot. The analyst shows the steps they took for each part of the analysis. They are confident that they have explained each step very thoroughly, but a stakeholder is confused when the presentation is over. They share a concern that the analysis may be incomplete.

2.  An analyst is presenting on the effectiveness of a new drug treatment for heartburn. They use data from an external private company that describes how common heartburn is in the United States. After the presentation, they receive an objection from their stakeholder about the data collected. The stakeholder is concerned that the source of the data may not be reputable, and is unsure about the credentials of the data’s source company.

3.  An analyst is presenting on the traffic patterns of a particular highway in their city. After extensive research and analysis, they conclude that Friday is the busiest day for commuters on that highway. One of the stakeholders, who commutes along that highway, disagrees and believes that Monday is the busiest day for traffic.
