Next, you can consider a few exemplary presentations. Before you get started, review the quick recap of the McCandless method. Then check out the examples below of spoken presentations and slide deck presentations and consider what makes a presentation effective.

As you look at examples in the next section of this activity, ask yourself: How do these presentations use the McCandless method?

As a refresher, the McCandless method is a set of guidelines for presentations. It suggests that you start with broad, general ideas and then work your way into the details.

The steps of the McCandless method include:

1. Introduce the graphic by name

2. Answer obvious questions before they’re asked

3. State the insight of your graphic

4. Call out data to support that insight

5. Tell your audience why it matters

### Examples of great spoken presentations

TED Talks are short, spoken messages with important ideas. Take some time to watch the three TED talks linked below, which were carefully selected as model examples of great presentations. As you watch the videos, ask yourself how they each show characteristics of an effective presentation:

1.  [The 3 bones of networking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OTPJZnBP8s)
2.  [Grit: The power of passion and perseverance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H14bBuluwB8)
3.  [Looking for a job? Highlight your ability, not your experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guXxy8LH2QM)

Click on the following links to see excellent examples of slide deck presentations. As you view each deck, ask yourself which characteristics of the slide deck make the presentation so effective.
