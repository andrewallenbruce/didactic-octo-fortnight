Consider the company, service, or product you chose in this reflection:

-   How could it use data to improve customer experience?
-   What kinds of data would it need to collect? 
-   How could insights from that data solve a problem?

I work in medical billing and coding, specifically revenue cycle management and I’ve been interested in analytics since graduating. However, since my entry into the field, I’ve been absolutely taken aback by the lack of enthusiam and often downright disdain for the implementation of advanced data analysis in this area of healthcare. Data analysis can not only be fairly easy to incorporate into the workflow but the benefits reaped would amount to nothing short of a paradigm shift in the business model. The data has been collected (i.e. diagnosis/procedure codes, fee schedules, provider lag times, payer mix, etc.) The insights to be gleaned (highest paying procedure for the worst performing provider, overpayments, underpayments, predictive modeling of financial performance) would be life-changing for clients, both provider and patient.
