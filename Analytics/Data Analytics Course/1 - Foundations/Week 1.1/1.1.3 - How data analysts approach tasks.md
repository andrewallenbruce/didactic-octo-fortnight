Earlier you learned about how data analysts at one organization used data to improve employee retention. Now, you’ll complete an entry in your learning log to track your thinking and reflections about those data analysts' process and how they approached this problem. By the time you complete this activity, you will have a stronger understanding of how the six phases of the data analysis process can be used to break down tasks and tackle big questions. This will help you apply these steps to future analysis tasks and start tackling big questions yourself.

## Review the six phases of data analysis

Before you write your entry in your learning log, reflect on [the case study](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/supplement/nhC19/case-study-new-data-perspectives) from earlier. The data analysts wanted to use data to improve employee retention. In order to do that, they had to break this larger project into manageable tasks. The analysts organized those tasks and activities around the six phases of the data analysis process: 

1.  Ask
    
2.  Prepare
    
3.  Process
    
4.  Analyze
    
5.  Share
    
6.  Act
    

The analysts **asked** questions to define both the issue to be solved and what would equal a successful result. Next, they **prepared** by building a timeline and collecting data with employee surveys that were designed to be inclusive. They **processed** the data by cleaning it to make sure it was complete, correct, relevant, and free of errors and outliers. They **analyzed** the clean employee survey data. Then the analysts **shared** their findings and recommendations with team leaders. Afterward, leadership **acted** on the results and focused on improving key areas.
