Another decision that needs to be made, at least several months prior to seeing your first patient in your office will be your Medicare participation decision. To me – the answer is simple - ENROLL AS A PARTICIPATING PHYSICIAN, but let’s examine what your 3 choices are and why I made that recommendation. The 3 choices you have are:
# Participation Status
## 1. Participating
This means you will accept assignment on every covered Medicare covered service you provide. As a participating physician, you have a 5% higher Medicare allowed amount than you would have if you were non-participating. You’re already required to file the claims and you’re going to be subject to the same scrutiny and coding requirements, regardless if you’re par or non-par. Being a par physician does NOT mean that you must see every Medicare patient that calls for an appointment, but it does mean you’ll accept Medicare’s assignment on each one you do see.

There are several reasons why I recommend all primary care physicians enroll in participating and they are mostly centered on the increased income that their clinics will enjoy by participating. Not only do they get the 5% increased allowed amount, and the hospitals are required to refer patients to participating physicians, but 35 years of working with physicians have taught us that physicians will accept assignment routinely on specific patients, including:
#### 1.  Hospital patients 
(Physicians seem very reluctant to pick through the patient’s purse or pants while they are seeing hospital patients to get their money).
#### 2.  Skilled and Non-Skilled Nursing Home patients
Ditto – the same thing
#### 3.  Office patients that receive expensive or extensive diagnostic testing in the clinic. 
The problem is also that the physicians that choose to not accept assignment are less likely to order or perform the diagnostic tests that the patients truly need, if they must ask the patient for the money – thereby resulting in mediocre or inferior medical care being rendered to the patient.
#### 4.  Patients with Medicaid as secondary insurance
(Patients with Medicaid as secondary usually – but not always – have very little money, so the opportunity to collect the Limiting Charge at the time of service is reduced).
## 2. Non-Participating
If you failed to sign the participation agreement, when you requested your Medicare number, then you are non-par and you have the choice whether to accept assignment or not accept assignment on a claim-by-claim basis. If you’re non-par, you can accept the assignment on one patient and then not accept it on the next patient, if you wish. If you do accept assignment, your allowed amount will be 5% less than it would be if you were a participating physician. If you’re going to see patients in the hospital or in the nursing home, where you’ll probably accept assignment anyway, you’ll make 5% less than if you were participating. Your fee to the Medicare patient can be collected at the time of service, from the patient, but your fee will be limited to the LIMITING CHARGE. That Limiting Charge is 15% above the non-par Medicare allowed amount, so you cannot charge and collect from the Medicare patient any amount you wish to. You are also still required to accept assignment on certain claims and specific services, such as clinical lab tests, regardless if you’re par or non-par.    
## 3. Opted-Out
These are physicians that have sent a letter to the Secretary of the Health & Human Services (HHS) notifying them that for a period of not less than 2 years, they will opt-out of the Medicare program and any services they provide to Medicare patients (other than emergency services) will not be reimbursed by the Medicare program. I do not EVER recommend this option to any primary care physicians.
    

# Medicare Patient Refuses Claims Filing

You may someday be presented with a Medicare patient that demands that you not file their claim to Medicare and they wish to pay for the service out of their own pocket. Since the PPACA law was passed (also called Obamacare), patients can withdraw temporary or permanent permission from you to file their insurance claims. How do you handle it, since you do not wish to withdraw from the Medicare program entirely, yet you wish to honor the patient’s request? The Medicare Carrier Manual addresses this.

It says: “The only situation in which non-opt out physicians or practitioners, or other suppliers, are not required to submit claims to Medicare for covered services is where a beneficiary or his/her legal representative refuses, of his/her own free will, to authorize the submission of a bill to Medicare. In this situation, the bill would not be submitted "on behalf of" the beneficiary. However, the limits on what the physician, practitioner or other supplier may collect from the beneficiary continue to apply to charges for the covered service, notwithstanding the absence of a claim to Medicare.”

This means that you may not collect more than Medicare’s allowable amount from the patient if you are participating or the Medicare Limiting Charge if you are not participating, even though you are not filing a claim to Medicare as the rules STILL protect the patient. You should also have the patient sign something refusing you permission to file the claim.
